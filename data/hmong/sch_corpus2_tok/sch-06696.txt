Tus yawg Tobe no puas yog tus thaum i kuv nrog tham lawm ne ?
ehehehehe I like your views above , Tobe .
ms I AM NOT A VANG PAO OR YANG DAO AND I HATE BOTH OF THEIR IDEALOGICAL BUT I THINK AS THE MEDIA DIG DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THIS SH1T IT WILL ONLY HELP THE GENERAL AND HIS ORGANIZATION .
IT WILL ONLY MAKE HIM MORE FAMOUS .
U GUYS CAN HATE THEM OR LOVE THEM ALL U WANTED AND U CAN BASH ALL U ALL U WANTED .
THE TRUTH IS VANG PAO DOESN'T GIVE MONEY TO THE LAOS COMMUNIST BUT YANG DAO IS .
VANG PAO DOESN'T KISS THE LAOS COMMUNIST'S . ASS BUT YANG DAO IS .
SO WHO IS GIVING MONEY AWAY INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING OUR KIDS TO GO TO SCHOOL ?
IS YANG DAO THE GUYS THAT GIVE THOUSANDS AND THOUANDS OF MONEY TO LAOS COMMUNIST KHAMTAI WHO IS A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE OR VANG PAO WHO IS FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM IN LAOS AND TRYING TO SUPPORT HIS SOLDIERS IN THE JUNGLE OF LAOS ?
YANG DAO IS A HYPOCRISE .
HE SPOKE AGAINST AGAINST VANG PAO'S IDEA OF RETURNING TO LAOS SOMEDAY BUT LOOK WHO IS RETURNING TO LAOS AND SUPPORTING THE LAOS COMMUNIST ?
YANG DAOS OFTEN MADE SPEECH ABOUT GOING TO SCHOOL , GET UR EDUCATION AND THIS IS UR COUNTRY BUT HIS GOAL IS RETURNING TO LAOS AND WORKING FOR THE LAOS GOVERMENT .
YANG DAO'S TRYING TO GET YOU INTO HIS ORGANIZATION AND THEN CONVERT YOU INTO HIS FOLLOWERS THAT IS WHAT HE DO .
I TALK TO SOME YANG LEADERS AND THEY TOLD ME WHAT YANG DAO THEM PLAN AND WILL DO .
HE TOLD ME THAT SOME OF THE YANG PEOPLE OFTEN COME TOGETHER AND MET AND SWEAR NOT TO LET THE SECRET OUT BY RAISING UR HAND INTO THE AIR , PROMISED AGAINST GOD , NOT TELL ANYONE OR GROUP ABOUT THEIR SECRET PLAN AGAINST VANG PAO .
THEIR PLAN IS TO GO AGAINST VANG PAO , HIS ORGANIZATION AND TOPPLE HIM .
AGAIN , THIS IS NOT FACT BUT WAS TOLD BY SOME YANG PEOLE THAT WAS VERY CLOSE TO YANG DAO AND HIS GROUP .
ABOUT VANG PAO , I BELIEVE HE IS SERIOUS ABOUT WINNING LAOS BACK BUT HE HAS NO POWER AND NO KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO DO IT .
I ALSO BELIEVE HIS ORGANIZAITON IS SO DISORGANIZE AND NOT WIDELY PLAN THAT IS IT IS NOT EFFECTIVE .
I HATE BOTH OF YANG DAO'S ORGANIZATION AND VANG PAO'S ORGANIZATION AND THEIR IDEAS .
AMEN
