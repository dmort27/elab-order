AND THAT WILL BE THE END OF ITELIPSISTOKENTEMSIS , YOG KOJ TSI NYOO POOB NTSEJ MUAG , THEN GO RIGHT AGHEAD AND KEEP ON MISSING THE TARGET AS YOU DID THIS PASS FEW DAYSELIPSISTOKENTHAT WOULD ONLY SHOW THAT THE " GREAT LOGICAL LAO " IS NOTHING MORE THAN A FOOLELIPSISTOKEN OFF THE SUBJECTELIPSISTOKENIGNORE THIS IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE ANALOGY .
WHEN A WOMAN TOUCHES YOUR CROTCHELIPSISTOKENTHAT USUALLY MEANS SHE IS READY TO PERFORM SOME SORT OF SEXUAL ACT WITH YOU .
WHEN SHE GOES DOWN ON YOU , THAT USUALLY MEANS SHE IS " ALMOST " THERE TO 2ND OR THIRD BASE WITH YOU .
MY ADVICE IS , STICK TO THE SEXUAL ACT , INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT LAO TZU , OR PLATO , OR " TALE OF TWO CITIES " WHEN SHE'S DOING U A FAVOR .
MY POINT IS , YOU BROUGHT UP ABSURDITY IN PAO'S ORIGINAL STATEMENT .
NOW , IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO USE LOGIC / COMMON SENSE / EDUCATION / SCIENCE TO BACK UP YOUR CLAIMELIPSISTOKENWE ALL KNOW THAT THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS IS A STRAGHT LINEELIPSISTOKENNOW IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO USE THIS LOGIC AND TELL ME WHY IT IS 'ABSURD' AS YOU SAID .
BY THE WAY , THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN " UNSUPPORTED , ILLOGICAL CLAIMS " AND " LOGICAL REASONONG " FOR CLAIMS .
CAN YOU DIFFERENTIATE THE TWO ?

PERHAPS DURING THIS HOT TEMPERED TIME , I FAILED TO REALIZED WHICH COMMENT I MADEELIPSISTOKENPLEASE , DO POINT OUTELIPSISTOKENMAYBE I COULD CLEAR IT UPELIPSISTOKEN MAYBE I WAS WRONGELIPSISTOKENBUT IF I'M WRONG , THEN OF COURSE , LIKE ANY MAN , I WILL ADMIT TO IT .
I'M NOT LIKE LAUJ , WHO MAKES ALOT OF CLAIMS , BUT FAIL TO SUPPORT THOSE CLAIMS .
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT , USUALLY THE MAIN PARTIES OF AN ARGUMENT SOMETIMES FAILED TO SEE THEIR " FAULTINESS . "
SO I DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO POINT OUT WHAT I SAID THAT SEEM TO BE OFFENSIVE .
