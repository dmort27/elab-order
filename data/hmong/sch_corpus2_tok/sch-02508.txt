IS AFFAIR STARTED BY THE WOMAN OR THE MAN ?
HOW DOES AN AFFAIR GET STARTED ?
CAN YOU HAVE AN AFFAIR EMOTIONALLY ( WITH GETTING PHYSICAL ) ?
Tej Laus niaj txis piv lus tias MAUM DEV tsis co tw TXIV DEV tsis lam nceELIPSISTOKENELIPSISTOKEN .
Yog yus paub tias yus muaj txiv lawm yeej tsis muaj tus lam zes tau yusELIPSISTOKEN .
Tiam sis yog tus nws muaj txiv los nim ua me hehehe hom hom hom ces tsis ntev mag lawm los masELIPSISTOKENELIPSISTOKEN !
SO , ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT'S THE WOMAN WHO STARTED THE AFFAIR ?
NOW , LET'S BE REAL .
LET'S LOOK AT CASES THAT HAPPENS AT WORK .
75 % OF ALL AFFAIRS HAPPENED AT THE WORK PLACE .
NOW , ARE YOU SAYING THAT AT WORK THE WOMAN IS THE ONE WHO INITIATED THE AFFAIR ?
ISN'T IT THE MAN WHO ALWAYS STARTED THE CONVERSATION , OR LOOK AT THE WOMAN DIFFERENTLY , OR TRYING TO PLEASE THE WOMAN AT FIRST ?
HMONG ALWAYS USE THE " MAUM DEV CO TW " BUT IN REALITY , IS THAT ALWAYS THE CASE ?
TO ME , AN AFFAIR ALWAYS STARTED BY THE MAN .
HE LOOKS , HE LIKES , HE LUST , HE LOVES AND THEN HE LEAVES HER SOMETHING TO PONDER FIRST .
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE .
4ever aw !
Pib ntawm nej cov niag poj niam tiaj las as .
Hmoob twb hais ib lo lus hais tias " poj niam ua qaib qua ces ntxia tau txiv neej sawv los sib tua no nev !
Thaum twg nej cov niag poj niam hais tias " ua tsis tau ces tsis yog txivv neej " no ces mag txiv neej xyuas kiag xwb mas I KNOW YOU MEN ARE FOR THE MEN .
BUT I THINK YOU GUYS ARE NOT FAIR AND NOT STICKING TO THE TRUTH .
OK , IF A MAN WALKS TO A WOMAN AND TOUCH HER , HOW CAN YOU SAY SHE STARTED IT ?
IT'S THE MAN WHO WALKS UP TO THE WOMAN !
SHE CAN ONLY RESPOND TO WHAT THE MAN DID , EITHER TO SAY SOMETHING OR NOT SAYING ANYTHING .
SEE , YOU MEN LIKE TO LABEL WOMAN AND BLAME THE WOMAN FOR ANYTHING BUT IF ALL WOULD JUST SIT IN THEIR OWN SEATS THEN NOTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED .
Although some have more control than others , given the right time , right person , and right place , any person will cheatELIPSISTOKENit is a naturally thing to do .
the question of " leejtwg pib ua ntej " ELIPSISTOKEN . qhov no cesELIPSISTOKENtwb yog 2 leeg pib uantej mas .
temsis , tus txiv neej yog tus ua muab ntxig nplo rau laivELIPSISTOKEN . ho pojniam mas , pw zoo zoo mloog with anticipation xwb , unless of coruse , the woman taakes charge .
maumdev txawm co tw heev npaum cas los yog tus txiv neej tsi kam ua thiab tsi xav ua , los yog tsi muaj lub mentality yuav mus ua , nws yeej tsi ua li .
pojniam los tib yam thiabELIPSISTOKENvim li no , 2 leeg pib tibtxhij at the right time cesELIPSISTOKEN . muaj affair xwb .
yaweh Qhov no mas ib txhia hais tias yog " affair of the eyes . "
Nkawd txawm tsis tau sib kov los yog tsis muaj physical touch los nkawd ob lub qhov muag twb muaj affair lawm .
Ob lub qhov muag ntawd twb sib daj sib dee tag lawm .
Koj puas paub , thaum nkawd sib daj sib dee hauv nkawd ob lub qhov muag xwb twb ua rau nkawd zoo nyob na !
There's a feeling of satisfaction or hunger for more nyob rau hauv lub nruab plaw tuaj .
Qhov ntawd ces thiaj li ua rau nkawd nrhiav sijhawm mus sib kov kom tau - begins with kissing and then caressing and then in bed .
So , yes , you can have an affair without getting physical .
Like now , some people here are fantasizing about you !
