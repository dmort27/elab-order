Lee , You answered to Tony Mouas' question here .
But I am not sure if I remember seeing a post by him asking you this question .
However , I did ask you questions closely relate to this topic as follow : " Mainas , Koj yog ib tus pojniam muaj txuj siab thiab tshawb txog hmoob kev kawm , nyob noj mus los thiab kev ua nom ua tswv los mus rau txiveej lub siab .
Ua li ntawd , koj puas tau tshawb txoj tias yog ua li cas pojniam hmoob , tus ruam , tus ntse ib nrab mus txog tus ntse ntse heev cia li khiav lawv tej txiv mus yuav asmeskas dawb , dub , mev thiab lwm haiv neeg li lawm ?
Koj thiab lwm tus pojniam muaj txuj siab hauv sch no puas yuav muab tau txhua txoj kev uas ua rau lawv cia li khiav mus yuav lwm haiv neeg yam tsis tau rauj txiv kom raws txoj cai ntawm hmoob los yog ntawm asmeskas ?
Ua tsaug uantej rau koj lub sijhawm teb cov lus nug no .
Tony , " Pardon me if this is not what you are answering to .
If it was what you thought you have answered to , then , the question was not why Hmong woman chose to marry outside the Hmong race .
The question that I asked was why , Hmong women run away from their Hmong husband to marry white , black , hispanic or other race etc .
without getting divorce prior to their marriage to the other race .
