Scratching my headELIPSISTOKENnot sure what you're saying ? ? ?
As far along as I have been on this forum , I have not wrongly acused of Hmong men for anything except phua ncaj ncaj hauv nruab nrab saib ncaj ncaj taug qab xwb naELIPSISTOKEN : ) ) Lajntxiag , when i said that there are always someone who is volunteering to be a victim is that when a woman get beat up by her boy friend or husband--she is not leaving him or goes to a shelter .
even after the meeting with many experts , she is volunteering herself to go back to the abuser , and that happens lots--so i conclude that she is volunteering to be the victim by herself .
it would be in a similarity to the man too , many times , a wife abuses him with verbal and restrict his freedom , but he is volunteering himself freely to go back to her in his own free will .
ib yam li tus pojniam ua tus txiv twb muab ntau ntau sab sab , es twb khiav mus nyob rau shelter los yog lwm qhov chaws lawm , nws tseem nco tus txiv dhau hwv lawm--tsi tsum lub siab li , rov qab mus es tus txiv muab ntau duas los yeej tsi khiav li awsELIPSISTOKEN . qhov volunteer term ua kuv hais rau haus no os .
ua li tej laus hais os , ntau ntau es tostsib lawm , sib ntau txhua hnub txhua hmo li no os .
hos tus muam deja , qhov kuv hais koj mas , vim yog koj muab tus Phone rau es kuv thiaj li hais tias , not all the times , pojniam hmoob ua no , yog lawv falsely acuse lawv tus txiv xwb .
yog tsi zoo siab tiag , tsi tag yuav mus call abuse hot line li aws---yog ib tug neeg es ntau yus lawm tiag , cias li mus sibnrauj ( divorce ) xwb .
nyob teb chaw america no lawm--divorce is easy as peeling a bannana xwb nev . es koj hus rau qhov hotline tag los , es koj tseem yuav rov mus yuav tus txiv duas---es yog yus volunteer yus tus kheej los yog yus yuav tso nws tseg es tsi yuav lawm mas !
kuv lub ntsiab lus rau koj mas yog li no xwb .
