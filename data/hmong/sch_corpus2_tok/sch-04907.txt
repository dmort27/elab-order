Kuv tsi paub lugnruag Moob , los tejzag lwmtug yuav has tas keebkwm Moob , zoo .
Cov lug kws xij has txug kev tseem moog yos / laij / nrhav taav / khub nuav , Moob yeem ibtxwm muaj lug puagthaum chivkeeb lawm los yog nyamqhuav tsim tshwm tawm thaum Moob pib paub txug the creation story as according to Eve was made out of Adam's rib lug xwb ?
Has there always been a story relate to this rib idea in our culture since the beginning of time too , or only been created when we start to have converters to Christianity ?
What about fate ?
Xij nov-nov txug cov lug qhuabqha rua cov kws maag luv taav ( heart broken lovers ) tas kuam puab tsi txhob xij chim-chim sab , tog nwg tsiv moog lawm los yeej vim nwg tsi tau yog yug tug taav tag .
Yog thaum ntsib yug tug taav tag ces yeej yuav dlhosnkaus rua xwb .
Ibtxha tau nrhav qaabteb rua qaumteb tamsis rov lug yuav tug nyob ntawm kwjtse .
Tej tug tsi ua lajleeb rua qhovtwg hlo le los nyob-nyob ces nim zoo le tug taav kws yeem yog yug tug tag-tag txawm cale lug dlhosnkaus rua yug , regardless wherever you are in the world--physical location wise .
So with this noj tsab / noj pebcaug season , nyob yaav ntuj qubqaab taabtom yog zoo caij zoo nyoog rua kev nrhav txwjnkawm , nhrav yug tug taav , just curious and want to know where did we got this rib idea from ?
Moob Lajleeb Nyob zoo Moob Twmzeej , Again , a very good question .
Zoo le Moob tub exposed rua Christianity in the 16 - 17th centuries lawm hab Moob tsi muaj written historical data ca ua puavpheej mas , kuv xaav tas , yuav tsi muaj leej twg paub tseebx tas qhov definition ntawd pib thaus twg lug lawm .
