WANTING TO BE A LAO CITIZEN IS NOT UNLAWFUL , BUT BEING A US CITIZEN AND IS INVOLVED IN ACTIVITIES AIMED AT DESTABILIZING A SOVEIGN NATION LIKE LAOS IS .
THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN SUCH ACTIVITIES OUGHT TO BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULL EXTEND OF THE LAWS .
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF THEY WANTED TO FIGHT THE LPDR SO MUCH , WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY HERE IN US ?
TO SLAVE THEMSELF , HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A PC AND THE INTERNET SERVICE , AND MAKING AN EMPTY THREAT TO THOSE WHO DISAGREED WITH THEM AND THEIR IDEOLOGY ?
WHAT A FUCKING LOSERELIPSISTOKENRAN AWAY FROM HOME SO THEY CAN MOUTH OFF ELSEWHEREELIPSISTOKEN . IS THAT THE HONORABLE CONDUCT WHICH THEY OFTEN CLAIM ?
BOY , TALKING ABOUT THESE FUCKING IDIOTS WON'T GET YOU ANYWHERE .
AMEN AMEN
