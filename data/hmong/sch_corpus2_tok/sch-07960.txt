hmonogloy . . i do believe that your post is correct .
many people ask me " es cov hmoob nyob suav teb ( all hmong ) puas coj li peb coj " ELIPSISTOKENi usually say " nco ntsoov tias peb ib leeg txia ib yam lawmELIPSISTOKENcov hmoob nplog teb tsi coj li hmoob suav teb nawbELIPSISTOKENvim tias cov nyob suav teb are too chineseELIPSISTOKENand cov nplog teb are too hmong . . " its a weird answer but its true .
i also believe that the word hmong yog ib qhov term tshiabELIPSISTOKENway newer than " miao " ELIPSISTOKEN . and hmong only applies to a certain " group " of miao .
