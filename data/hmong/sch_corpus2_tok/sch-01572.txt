NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTIONS .
AMERICA DOESN'T NEED A BULLET TRAIN .
IT WILL NEED SOMETHING ELSE LIKE ELECTRIC CARS .
NOW IF CHINA BUILDS A BULLET TRAIN LINKING MAINLAND CHINA TO PHUKET AND SINGAPORE THEN IT WILL MEAN ECONOMIC PROGRESS FOR THE WHOLE REGION .
IF THAT HAPPENS , I WILL RIDE IT FROM VTE TO PHUKET AND ENJOY PATONG BEACH .
