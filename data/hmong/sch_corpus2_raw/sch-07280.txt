JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEW FROM YOU, THAT DOESNS'T MAKE
THEM LESS OF A PERSONS THAN YOU.
I APOLOGIZE FOR MISTAKEN YOU AS A PERSON WHO IS ABLE TO RESPECT
OTHER'S POINT OF VIEW. I THOUGHT YOU COULD CARRY ON A DISSCUSION
WITHOUT PERSONAL INSULTS. YOU'D HAVE KNOWN BETTER.  UNTIL THEN, HAVE A
GOOD DAY.
