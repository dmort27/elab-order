WANTING TO BE A LAO CITIZEN IS NOT UNLAWFUL, BUT BEING A US CITIZEN
AND IS INVOLVED IN ACTIVITIES AIMED AT DESTABILIZING A SOVEIGN NATION
LIKE LAOS IS. THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN SUCH ACTIVITIES OUGHT TO BE
PROSECUTED TO THE FULL EXTEND OF THE LAWS.
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF THEY WANTED TO FIGHT THE LPDR SO MUCH, WHY THE
FUCK ARE THEY HERE IN US? TO SLAVE THEMSELF, HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A
PC AND THE INTERNET SERVICE, AND MAKING AN EMPTY THREAT TO THOSE WHO
DISAGREED WITH THEM AND THEIR IDEOLOGY? WHAT A FUCKING LOSER...RAN
AWAY FROM HOME SO THEY CAN MOUTH OFF ELSEWHERE....IS THAT THE
HONORABLE CONDUCT WHICH THEY OFTEN CLAIM? BOY, TALKING ABOUT THESE
FUCKING IDIOTS WON'T GET YOU ANYWHERE.
AMEN
AMEN
