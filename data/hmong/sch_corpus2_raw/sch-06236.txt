every instrument has some "prelude" note/sound that must be played in
order to make the "song" flow nicely...
1)  qeej....you begin by playing cov ntiv....such as "tsum los lood
li lu tsu...."
2) raj nplaim begins with "ploog lam..ploog lam (or pwm lam as you said)
.....los lum lam...etc.."
3) xem xaus (nkauj laug ncas) begins with "qeeg qeeg qwm qwm (note that
i'm just imitating the sound)...qeeg qeeg qwm qwm qwm....cab xyoob
nuav...."
4)raj ntsaws is harder notes..."pib pib lau...pib pib lus lo lus lum
lib......"
5) ncas...bi yau...bi yau...koob loob lais lum laub...."
sounds kinda weird, but it sounds better playing it...
yaweh
