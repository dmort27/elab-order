MS,
Tej kev uas cov nom tswv thaud tau quab yuam luag tej ntxhais ua dev
ua npua los sis ua niam yau no mas peb cov pojniam twb tsis tau muab
hais tawm kiag li nawb.  Ua ib tug pojniam mas koj raug luag rape los
koj yeej txhaum, koj raug yuam ua niam yau los koj yeej swb tag li xwb
vim lub ntuj qub qab, tej txiv neej yeej muaj xiv.  Dhau ntawd yog
tseem yog nom tswv thiab ces lawv yog nqis kiag ntawm lub ntuj lub teb
xwb ces ib tug nyuag pojniam lub neej twb tsis muaj nqi npaum ib daim
ntaub so ko taw.
Thaum ub kuv tseem hluas thiab ruam mas kuv pom cov ntxhais
savadikarne los sis lao luam phao mas kuv xav tias cov no yog cov
pojniam/hluas nkauj tsis tsim txiaj tiag vim lawv deev luag txiv thiab
ua luag niam yau.  Dhau ntawd muaj ib txhia tseem hais tias cov no mas
yog meb cab xwb.  Peb lub Hmong society thaud qhia kom yus xav mus li
ntawd ces qas pojniam txiv neej sawvdaws look down on these girls.
Thaum kuv paub tab thiab pom kev deb zog tuaj kuv thiaj mam to taub
tias cov ntxhais no tsuas yog nrhiav kev khwv noj khwv haus thiab
survive in an impossible male dominated society.  Consider this - koj
niam/txiv yug tau ib pab ntxhais xwb, liaj teb tsis muaj ua vim muaj
tsov muaj rog, what opportuntities did these girls have?  Many hoped
to attract a young Hmong man so they will be married before being
raped or forced to marry a married man.  Some were lucky but many more
were not.
Anyway, tham tsawg los sawvdaws yeej paub ntau lawm vim tej no
happened in front of everyone's eyes.  Can you imagine being a woman,
was raped by stranger and then forced to marry the rapist?  Or being
13-14 years old and was forced to marry a married man in his 30-50s? I
heard horrible story of young new bride who kept fighting her husband
and ended up being tied to the bed so her husband can have sex with
her.  There are also those girls who were so disgusted with their
husband and his sexual abuse that they committed suicide.
So, where am I going with this?  I just want to clarify that my
mention of lao luam phao girls is not to further disgrace them but to
remind everyone of the "sins" of our fathers as well as our own so
that mistake will not repeat itself for the sake of our children and
future generation.  Thanks for reading.
