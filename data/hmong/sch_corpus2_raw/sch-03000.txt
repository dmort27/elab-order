I'm new at this but i have a question.  Recently I saw a video
produced by Hmoob Moj Them, i think the video was about Hmong people
in Thailand (Dej Dawb) who was being persecuted by the Thai.
I was disturbed by this video and i like to hear your opinion.
1.  The narrator (i think Yeu Pheng Xiong) said Hmoob Moj Them is the
only organization that Hmong trust, that's why the video was sent to
him.  Is this true?
2.  Is HMT a political party in the Hmong?
3.  Is HMT doing anything to help the Hmong in DD?  or just promoting
their name in the video?
I am curious on your thinking about these issues.  Thanks.
