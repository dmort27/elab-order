hmonogloy..
i do believe that your post is correct.  many people ask me "es
cov hmoob nyob suav teb (all hmong) puas coj li peb coj"...i usually say
"nco ntsoov tias peb ib leeg txia ib yam lawm...cov hmoob nplog teb
tsi coj li hmoob suav teb nawb...vim tias cov nyob suav teb are too
chinese...and cov nplog teb are too hmong.."  its a weird answer but its
true.
i also believe that the word hmong yog ib qhov term tshiab...way newer
than "miao"....and hmong only applies to a certain "group" of miao.
