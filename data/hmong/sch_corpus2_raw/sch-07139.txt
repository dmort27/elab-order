M.M. Lee,
You answered to Tony Mouas' question here.  But I am not sure if I
remember seeing a post by him asking you this question.  However, I
did ask you questions closely relate to this topic as follow:
"Mainas,
Koj yog ib tus pojniam muaj txuj siab thiab tshawb txog hmoob kev
kawm, nyob noj mus los thiab kev ua nom ua tswv los mus rau txiveej
lub siab.  Ua li ntawd, koj puas tau tshawb txoj tias yog ua li cas
pojniam hmoob, tus ruam, tus ntse ib nrab mus txog tus ntse ntse heev
cia li khiav lawv tej txiv mus yuav asmeskas dawb, dub, mev thiab lwm
haiv neeg li lawm?  Koj thiab lwm tus pojniam muaj txuj siab hauv sch
no puas yuav muab tau txhua txoj kev uas ua rau lawv cia li khiav mus
yuav lwm haiv neeg yam tsis tau rauj txiv kom raws txoj cai ntawm
hmoob los yog ntawm asmeskas?
Ua tsaug uantej rau koj lub sijhawm teb cov lus nug no.
Tony,"
Pardon me if this is not what you are answering to.  If it was what
you thought you have answered to, then, the question was not why Hmong
woman chose to marry outside the Hmong race.  The question that I
asked was why, Hmong women run away from their Hmong husband to marry
white, black, hispanic or other race etc. without getting divorce
prior to their marriage to the other race.
