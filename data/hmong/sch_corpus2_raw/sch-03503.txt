Nkauj Hnub nis nkauj Hnub,
Kuv twb tau saib hmoob daim movies ua "Maum nuj Laus noj zaub mos"
lawm tiag.  Koj sim mus yuav los saib meb..Zoo saib kawg li ho!  Teb
chaw no Poj niam muaj cai loj ntug ntoob yam li ib lub hauv tsua...es
koj tseem ho los ua niam yau thiab...yuav txiv yau twb tau na...txhob
cim cim...ho koj niam yau es, he he he!

Noobsaum Nhubkaj,
we are two different people, we must do have agree and disagree with
each other...however, if you want to stae your opinion, then do so
tell us as your own opinion piece and state your reason why or why
not. we surely would understand where you stand. since you were not
coming clean with your own opinions and stands...and that is how we
got to this point of disagreement.
many times, our disagreement of a conversation was not meant to be,
but we just simply cannot communicate our own message across to the
other person. ..yog yuav muab hais ces, tim peb xwb--yog yus tsi
nyiam, yus cias li hais kiag tias, kuv mas tsi nyiam txoj kev ua niam
hlob niam yau, vim yog li nram no....uas leej twg yuav tsi paub yus
txoj kev xav thiab kev ntshaw nab...paub kawg nkaus li.  tabsi peb
tseem yuav mus muab luag lwm leej lwm tus txoj niag kev gossips thiab
muab lub ua cuav rau yus cov lus.  thaum zoo li no, peb cov neeg nyob
rau theem #3 no...LOL!, peb tsi xav hnov thiab mloog lus paj lus cuas
thiab txoj niag kev gossip no li lawm nad, es thiaj li hais
xwb....LOL!  yog li lwm zaag, yog yuav hais dabtsi, txhob zam kev deb
deb puag tim toj roob ua hmoob nyob nawb.  yuav tsum ua li luag lawm
haivneeg thiab, nrau kiag hauv lub niag plawv roob kom khoob lug.
thaum zoo li no ces peb cov neeg nyiam nyiam zoo no, peb tsi cam
li...tsua muaj qhua xwb ***@Noobsaum Nhubkaj!

HK,
thank you, that is our hmong men's wisdom...soliciting for other
opinions...and critical for strategic planning...as it goes around and
around in a circle that nothing gets to be finished at the end of the
day.
don't you agree that is the very reason our hmong men never think of
"Haiv" or gaining any valuable...............  because we kept running
around in a circle all our lives?  you lived in the Twin Cities, for
sure you must encounter many organizations, such that they were moving
in a circle.  therefore, the things that had been discussed today may
be discussed again the same points for years from now, and then
nothing has been done or changed from it. (tham tag hnub no lawm los,
yog rov tham duas ces sawv daws yeej rov sib cam thiab tham duas thiab
tham duas tsi muaj hnubkaj los yog hnubkawg li no). twb tsi hais cov
KoomHaum nad, hauv SCH no xwb los--tej lus peb tham tham no, xyov peb
twb tham txog puas tsawg caum zaus li lawm nawb...tabsi peb yeej tsi
kawg tseg es hos muab kho kom txawj zoo li nad.  nyob nyob peb sos
txaus lawm ces rov sib cam thiab sib tshum cov lus uas peb twb ib txwm
tham tag los lawm duas...tos peb haivneeg hmoob no tsi mus tsi los
qhov twg li los, ntshe yog tim peb lawm tiag nawb, koj puas xav li
thiab?
smiles!
