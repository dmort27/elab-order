Dr. Pao,
Yus yog ib tug neeg nyob muaj koob muaj npe, muaj teb muaj chaw, muaj
nom muaj tsw, muaj hauv paus hauv ntsis, tsi tsim nyog yus yuav lam tau
lam coj yus cov haujlwm tseem ceeb los yog tej lus tawm tsam muaj nuj
nqis tuaj rau sawvdaws muaj nrhuav pis dog pis dig hauv tej nyuag tshav
puam li SCH no nav.
When you spill your seemingly well founded frustrations to this type of
public forum, rather than strictly through legitimate channels, you
inevitably subject yourself to all kinds of unnecessary labels,
verbiage, and general disrespect and sneering...that even Lao
government officials themselves engage in themselves.
I think you should rise above that.
