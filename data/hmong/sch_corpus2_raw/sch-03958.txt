after hundreds of years of separation, the zaj qeej suav no...tseem
zoo li qub....zaj qeej no yog qeej "me pluag".....cov ntiv starts at
4:34, cov npe starts at 5:00...and ends at 6:15...temsis zaj qeej
tshuab tsi tag..tseem tshuav ib cov ntiv nyob hauv thiab... temsis
lawd tsi tshuab lawm...lawd muab xaus right after zaj qeej tag...
when i first heard of zaj qeej pluas no from a friend in china (nws
muab xa rau kuv mloog), kuv xav tias ntshe yog hmoob meskas tshuab
using qeej suav, temsis zoo zaj no yog qeej moob suav tiag....cov ntiv
tseem zoo nkaus peb cov hmoob nplog/meskas li.

yaweh

actually,
cov zaj qeej no can be played anywhere....ntiv qeej, qeej tshoob,
pluag, plig, xub etc are not considered taboo in terms of location
chosen to be played.  cov qeej uas hmoob tsi play inhouse ces yog cov
"qeej tuag" xwb.
yaweh

kuv tub qha tas there is only one type of qeej which is taboo...there
are qeej tshoob, qeej nyuj dlaab, plig, noj tsab, tsaa hauv toj etc
that are not tabooo....
what exactly are you getting at?  can you please list the things that
are taboo...?
yaweh
