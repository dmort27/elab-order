Koj lub tswvyim (the idea) mas zoo lawm tawm sis tsi work. Koj puas
pum hab paub tseeb lawm has tas peb Hmoob muab Hmoob haavzoov rau sua/
w (bait) kuas lub nplaj teb paab peb tsuj teb chaws Nplog puas yuav
muaj neeg tsaa qhov muag saib maj? No way... Yug turn the blind eyes
on yug tawb quav ces luas kuj ntxaab ntxawm "turn luas lub blind eyes"
rua yug qhov issue xwb. Again, as many people have stated, I strongly
believe that if we, Hmong, want to resolve the Hmong-Jungle issue in a
humanitarian way then it would have been solved long time ago. It is
crystal clear to the international communities and the U.S. government
as to what we really want that's why the issue remain unsolved. Leej
twg noog puab (hmoob haavzoov) cov lug plea for help taag es tseem tsi
to taub ces tug ntawd yeej yog xaav muab puab rau sua rua nwg qhov
political and economic gain nkausx xwb, nothing more.

Qhov sad tshaj plaws rau DYD mas yog tias .... even when GVP is in
jail, GVP still command more popularity than DYD.  Qhov no ua rau DYD
tshuav npo pa.  DYD xav nrov dhau lawm ua li cas los yawg tsis tau
attention li ces ua rau yawg tshuav vwm xwb. Kuv surprise tias cas
niag DYD no hlwb ruam ua luaj.
DYD xav nrov dhau lawm he will do anything for attention, even when
his action harms him more than his apponent.
