txaus ntshai kawg kiag li tiag. but, as with all these hmong stories,
tseem tshuav ib qho pheej ua rau kuv tsis ntseeg tus so-called victim
kom tas tas thiab. vim tias, nws twb paub aib thaub hmoob lis ntawv
lawm (they were acquaintances). yog nws yog ib tug ntxhais zoo ua li
cas luag tej ho yeev duab pom nws liab qab (los yuav luag liab qab)

i think the website to stop stalkers is good, but it needs to educate
women on prevention---how not to put yourself in a situation that
could lead to nude photography/videos and stalking. the site is more
intervention than prevention. which, by then, could be too late.
