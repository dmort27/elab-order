ai rayam phuan,
What a laotian speaking thai!!! Lao Buddhism came from Cambodia not
Siam...!
Meung nanh lae park sia, Meung darr khone hmong ma nane leo, thuk thee
thi meung phud ork ma manh menh sarb ru mai? your mouth is so stinky?
Mai cham penh tong rai thamma rork, ku ru leo.

HMONGOLIANS OF ST. PAUL AND WAUSAU DON'T NEED TO SPEND ANY MONEY TO
HOST THAT FIVE TIME DRAFT DEFERMENT CHANEY 'CAUSE HE AIN'T YOUR
FRIEND, HE CAN'T AND WON'T DO ANYTHING REGARDING THE HMONGOLIAN ISSUES
AND DREAMS OF ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT STATE. IF THIS
ADMINISTRATION IS SO SERIOUS ABOUT WORLD TERRORISM AS THEY PROCLAIMED,
THEY SHOULD OFFICIALLY LABEL THIS FFC AND OTHER HMONGOLIAN SUBVERSIVE
GROUPS OF THUGS AS TERRORISTS, PROSECUTE THEM FOR THEIR CRIMES AND
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES AIMED AT DESTABLIZING A SOVEIGN NATION OF LAOS.
UNITED STATES MUST STOP HARBORING TERRORISTS LIKE THESE BADASS
HMONGOLIANS.
BESIDES, WHY DON'T THEY SPEND THIS KIND OF MONEY AND EFFORTS ON THEIR
OWN PEOPLE IN THE JUNGLE WHO WERE BEING PERSECUTED AS PROCLAIMED BY
THESE TORRORISTS? TO ME, IT IS EITHER THEIR CLAIMS OF HMONGOLIAN
KILLING FIELD IS FICTITIOUS OR THEY JUST DON'T LOVE THEIR OWN
HMONGOLIANS OF THE JUNGLE NO MORE.
AMEN
