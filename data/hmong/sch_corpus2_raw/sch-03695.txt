Don't worry about YD. Next time you go to Laos make sure koj rov qab
mus coj koj cov muam mus nojfawm thiab coj mus puag pws xwb lomas. For
you, it will not cost LPDR $600. It only cost them one bullet through
your head.

Cov neeg ruam, koj yuav tau hais lus ruam rau es nws thiaj lis totaub.

HMOOB,
PLEASE DO NOT HATE EACH OTHER IT'S TIME FOR US TO UNDERSTAND ONE
ANOTHER WE BEEN LIEING TO LONG TO OUR HMONG PEOPLE IT'S TIME TO TELL
THE TRUTH AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR OUR HAIV HMOOB, TO ME I THINK WE
ARE IN A VERY CONFUSE STAGE IF YOU HAVE THE GUTS GO  TO THE COUNTRY OF
LAOS AND TELL THEM THAT YOU WANT THE LAOS TO STOP KILLING OUR BROTHER
AND SISTERS.
