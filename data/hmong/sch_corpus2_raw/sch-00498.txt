YOU BELONG TO MR. AND MRS. MONG GROUP I AM RIGHT? DON'T CALL US HERE
H/MONG HERE.  WE ARE HMONG AND HMONG FOREVER. TELL YOUR BROTHER MONG
POBZEB TO FUCK HIMSELF OFF TELL HIM TO TAKE HIS HAND OFF THE HMONG

I HATE PEOPLE THAT EDUCATED AND STUPID.

Tobe,
How can you not know what Hmong mean?  Hmong yog peb niam peb txiv lub
npe just as America is named after a European named Amerique...
Hmong ces yog peb txiv lub npe?  It means freedom...
