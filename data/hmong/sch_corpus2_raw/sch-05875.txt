Cov kwvtij Hmoob,
Cas zoo li nej tsis muaj leej twg kam los teb kuv qhov question nram
qab no kiag li. Hmoob los lus hais tias thaum raug luag ces yus tau zoo
luag, tab sis thaum raug yus ces kawg tuag ces yog tej no ntag laus cov
yawg.
Raws li kuv pom nyob rau peb Hmoob txhua tus (including koj thiab kuv)
ces nws tsuas muaj 3 txog kev taug lawm xwb yog thaum koj muaj qhov
teeb meem zoo li nram qab no lawm.
1.  Do nothing or ignore the problem.  This is very unlikely (less than
1%) the Hmong people would choose this option.
2.  Hu police coj tus tub mus kaw.  This is very unlikely either.
Probably less than 5% that the Hmong would choose this option.
3.  Cia nkawv sib yuav.  This is the most likely option (99%) the Hmong
would choose.  I would choose this option and I am very sure all of you
would choose this as well.  Remember in this country you are not guilty
unless caught and proven.  Let me ask you this.  Would you report your
dad to the police if you see him do opium at your home?  No, I don't
think so.  Now does this make you guilty or break the law because you
allow him to do opium at your home without calling the police.  No, not
unless you are caught and proven.
Now if you don't agree with me, then what would you do?  Is there any
other options out there?  Don't be afraid to say it guys if you do have
a better option out there because sooner or later, it could be you,
your brother, cousin, or friend. Sharing an idea now won't hurt
anything.
-Cha.
Case #1.  Koj tus ntxhais muaj 14 xyoos muaj me nyuam tsaub lawm vim
koj tus dab laug tus tub muaj 18 xyoo tuaj deev muaj.  Koj thiab koj
tus dab laug tsev neeg mas sib hlub heev thiab thaum koj dab laug tus
tub tuaj pib tham koj tus ntxhais los koj yeej zoo siab hlo cia rau
tham vim tus tub ntawd kuj yog ib tug tub zoo nraug, txawj ntse thiab
ua dab tsi yog dab tsi.  Tus ntxhais thiab tus tub no nkawv yeej sib
nyiam heev thiab yeej txaus siab sib yuav ua niam txiv. Zaum no koj
paub hais tias koj tus ntxhais muaj me nyuam lawm, koj tus ua niam los
yog ua txiv yuav ua li cas?
Case #2. The story is the same as case #1 above except that you are the
parents of the son instead.  What would you do?

Cha awd...coj mus abort kiag xwb los mas cas yuav nyuaj ua luaj li ne
and tell them if they so wish to get marry, they have to wait until the
right age. I would not risk my life with it.

Nyob zoo Chav,
Ua tsaug rua koj tej lug koj tau faib sau toj nuav. Raws le kuv tug
kheej tau siv lug mas kuv saib hab treat each situation differently.
Yuav tsumntsuag ob tug neeg involved saib puas yuav muaj xwm dlaab tsi
rov yam peg suab (future). Kuv always make sure kuv tug tub los tug
ntxhais to taub txuj cai lijchoj. Yog kuv tsis to taub qhov twg kuv
yuav tsum moog cuag lawyer los yog court officials kuas kuv paub hab to
taub zoo txug kuv qhov legal responsibility. Qhov twg ua tau kuv le ua.
I will not take the risk to let my kids live together as husband and
wife without consulting the laws or authorities concerned.
