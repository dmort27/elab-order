Australia thiab. Peb tsawg tsawg tabsis peb kuj yog neeg Australia uas
pejkum peebchaws kuj saib peb ib yam li ib tus neeg Australia thiab.
Tsis tag lino xwb, Australia yog ib lub tebchaws uas muaj kev phookywg
zoo nrog tebchaws Los Tsuas, Lino, tej qhov uas nej cov Hmoob USA ua
tsis tau, tejzaum peb cov hmoob Oz kuj ho yuav muaj kev pab tau kum
muaj thiab.
Lino, kuv thiaj xav kom pev sawvdaws :Act locally tabsis THINK
GLOBALLY...
Kom xav tias peb Hmoob sawvdaws yeej caij tib lub nqoj xwb. Yog peb ib
leeg nquas peb lus nkoj Mus ib sab li yus nyiam xwb, PEB leej nqo mus

Txij no mus kom peb yuav tsum los mus nquam nqob kom muaj rythm li tej

neeg liam tsev, pheej yuav ua kom tau yus nyiam li xwb.  Kom xav li
Abraham Lincold tau hais cia, I shall prepare, my time will come". Tej
no yeej muaj tseeb.  Raws li kuv tus kheej, ib tug Hmoob nyob Oz, kuv
yeej prepare los tau 30 xyoo lawm tias muaj ib hnub kuv yuav tsum raum
luag caws ua ib tug VIPO mus LOs Tsuas teb. That is one of my goal
that I have set some 30 years ago... lino hnub txog yug thib, yus yeej
the RIGHT person ntag.... ces luag yeej yuav thuaj THOV yus mus.  Tus
Ambassador Los Tsuas tau hu xov-tooj tuaj cawv kuv personally txog ob
zawg kuv this kam mus Laos xyoo 2006 li ib tus VIP, uas yus mus qhov
twg luag muaj Police caij motor ua ntev kom tej lus txav kev kom tag,
uas yus yeej tsis nres tej teeb liab li... yus mus txog qhov twg, tej
Phao ban, Chao Mouang, Chap khoueng yeej tuaj tos yus tag li tus VIP.
Tus uas raug escort yus mus mas yuav tsum yog in tus Athibodee xwb
thiab muaj peevxwwm ua tua coj yus kev...pem qhaum teb thoob qab
teb,,TEJNO YOG IB QHOV EXAMPLE rau sawvdaws pom xwb - tsis yog yuav
tuaj khav dabtsis tabsis kuv piav ua ib qhov illustration tias..we
must prepare, we must study - undertake a self-education program (For
me, I have read about 50 books/year... so in total about just 150+
books on all subjects that is outside my medical field). I was
fortunate to meet a great leader many years ago and he told me that if
you want to be WHOM you wnat to be, you must INVEST on your BRAIN - so
I have been  doing just that over the alst 30 years) .  SO..If you are
well PREPARE, YOUR TIME will come as Abrham Lincoln once siad.
So, peb sqawdaws yuavv tsum pib prepare peb tus kheej kom peb sawvdaws
PAUB TSAUS, kom peb no muaj PEEJXWM nrog luag poejkum tecbchawm neeg
SAWV TAU SIB TXIG, shoulder to shoulder, kom luag RESPECT peb ib lawm
li lwm haiv neeg.
Tabsis ua ntev peb yuav ua tau li no, pev yuav tsum paub tias PEB YOG
LEEJ TWG, peb lub HOMPHIAJ zoo dabtsis, peb KEV THIAG TAW yog dabtsi,
puab ruaj txaus. Li thaum kuv mus Laos, kuv kev thiag-taw yog kuv lub
tebchaws thiab kuv tus Oz Ambassador nyob Vte tibsis. Libno, kuv kev
mus Laos yuav risky npaun twg los, at least yus yeej muaj kev thiag-
taw ruaj txaus... but nothing is 100% safe,,, but if you do not RISK,
you do not live life to the fullest. Every thing is risky but at least
IF it is an caculated risk zoo li rag teev uas  yus muaj luj saib,
licas los yus sab yeej hnyav dua lawm ces, it is the right thing to
take on the risk.
Peb Hmoob no tseem ntse tsis tau tsaus. Peb tseem muaj xav ntiav heev_+
+ li uas tsis phim tias peb muaj kev txhawj kev ntse. 100 tsav yav
hauv kev ua neej, politic, no yeej yoojyim thiab yeej nkagsiab tau
zoo, yog peb muab xav kom nws simple xwb. kom peb xav tias ib tus neeg
li Souphanouvong khiag xwb, rawv li cov Npooj Tsawb 30 xyoo hais rau
kuv tias luag twb tsis ntseeg yawg tias yawg yog tus liab nad!  Lino
es peb Hmoob tseem tsi nkag siab thiab ces, txhais tau tias peb hmoob
feemcoob tseem ntse tsis tau txog theem uas yuav mus nrog luag sib
txuas lus thiab ua politic tau.
Lino es thov kom 2012 no, kow sawvdaws tig los xaav rau yus tus kheej
ua ntej. know who you are, what platform u are standing, are you on
the RIGHT track... to Hmmob lub Homphiab?
First of all, know you know, and know you do not know.\
Be prepare and your time will come. If you are the right person,
people will come searching for you, no mattre where you may be. If you
GOO enough, you will be found.... just make sure that you are GOOD
enough and you are PREPARE and be Ready.  Real LEADER is found AT The
RIGHT TIME.  So, all we need to do is to be good people, serving our
family well, as the pre-requiste., Them serve our extended family and
out clan members and just SERVE any Hmong that call on you. If you
aspire to be a leader, just think aboutn the degree and amount of
SERVICE that you provide to your people... Never try to be a leader.
Just be the best Servant to humanity...
Then....Your CALLING (Opportunity) will come to you any time if you
are well PREPARE (Knowledge, experieence, finacially + great serice
provider) +READY (  having the time, good health & mobility) + having
the  RIGHT PERSONALITY + BE AT THE RIGHT TIME + RIGHT PLACE  in
history.
Among the above QUALITIES, the most IMPORTANT FACTOR, as I have
learned from reading the biographies of the great achievers in the
history of mankind (just few 100+ peopel), is PERSONALITY.  Many
people have all other qualities but they have the WRONG type of
PERSONALITY.
Basically, there are 4 main type of PERSONALITY.
1. The Choleric - The Doer - Domineering type...Like GVP, Nixon
2. The Thinker -eg. THE Perfectiknist...THEY SPENT ALL THEIR TIME
PLANING, THINKING BUT NEVER GET AROUND TO SARAT ANYTHING.
3. The Sanguine - like Ronald Regan - He was defeated in his run for
the Republican presidential nomination in 1968 as well as 1976, but
won both the nomination and election in 1980... when America is
devasted from the Viertnam war. Reagan is need to bring LIVE to the US
people thru his humor.
4. The Phlegmatic - peace maker.. eg. Geroge Bush (father), Johnson,
Carter. Obama.

Each person will rise to the DEMAND of the situation.  Therer are many
young Hmong who are eager to rise to be the Hmong leaders. But, many
of these young intellectuals, some of the brightest young Hmong, but
the proplem is that they have the WRONG type of personality and they
will NOT be fit  to be a Hmong leader, given the presnenta state of
the Hmong communities that is gfragmented and yearning to be back as
one communities once again. So, those Hmong intellectuals have been
born at the WRONG time.  They are to good people that the Hmong do not
wanted now.  Their personalities is NOT fitting for the present
situation. In recent time, I have suggested to few Hmong
intellectuals, some of the brightest young Hmong who wanted to emerge
as the Hmong leaders but they have the Choleric personality which is
NOT what the Hmong wanted to have now. They disregard my advice, some
even misunderstood my advice as beeing against them... and they
proclaim themselves but overnight, they discovered that they are NOT
the sorth of leader that the Hmong wanted.
We must understand that the Hmong are a fragmented community... The
Hmong communitities are searching for a NEW leader (not the GVP-like
person - not a Choleric who do what he wants reagrdless of the people
may think) but a Phegmatic - a PEACMAKER PERSON who can get along with
all sections of the communities, who can accommodate all fractions,
all sections --getting along with every strata of the communities, who
CAN BRING ALL THE HMONG BACK TOGETHER.
So... may 2012... be the year that the RIGHT Hmong leader emerger to
bring unity, harmony to the ahmong communities across the globe.
Cheerio...

Dr. Pao,
Ua tsaug rau koj cov lus qhuab qhia peb sawv daws.  Koj cov lus lub
ntsiab tseeb ces
1.  Koj xav qhia rau sawv daws paub tias koj yeej prepared thiab ready
ua ib tus thawj coj lawm es kom sawv daws must be prepared and ready
ib yam li koj.
2. Hais txog qhov hlub Hmoob, tsuav yus hais tau kom ua tau li yus
hais es ua ib tus qauv rau sawv daws xyaum thiab follow xwb.
3. Nej cov VIPs raug nom tswv Nplog caw mus es muaj police motor nrog
nraim yam muaj ntsej muaj muag li koj hais ces nws tsis txawv qhov
before 1975 es lawv caw huab tais Sisavangvathana mus xyuas Muang
Vieng Xay ntag nawb.... thiab later es caw yawg Phanyas lawv mus
meeting pem Sam Neua, thiab caw yawg General Bounpone Maktheparack,
Supreme Commander of the Royal Lao Army mus visit China, but after the
visit, his plane landed in Sam Neua, not Wattay.  The difference tsuas
yog thaum ntawd yog 75's hos nej li mas yog the 90's lawm xwb.... Tab
sis they are always the winner politically and you are the loser...
Qhov kuv hais li no tsuas yog my personal opinion xwb.  Li cas los you
have the rights to say what you said... Best, YingB
