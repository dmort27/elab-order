Ua tsaug!!!!!! Kuv ma xav los ntev heev lawm tabsis tsis paub yuav hais
licas thiaj zoo. muaj ib txhia yeej ua zoo kawg lawm thiab tabsis tseem
muaj ib txhia hais luv phem heev li; xyov hnubtwg es Hmoob thiajli yuav
txawjxav ib yamnkaus.  Txawm li ntawd los kuv twb pom tau tias cov coob
yog cov zoo lawm tsuas yog muaj qho nyuag thiaj li tseem pheej ua dev
raws nqaij thiab hais lus cuag li yus thiajli yog neeg xwb.  Xyog nws
puas yuav paub li ntawd thiab muaj qhov hwm lwmtus.  Ua neeg nyob yog
yus tsis hwm luag ces luag yeej tsis hwm yus ib yam.  In order to get
some in return you must heavily invest yourself.  We could only reap
what we saw but only take a part of the whole to see.

The turning point is, grasp at the shadow and we may lose the
substance.  There will always be some who will attack the people rather
than tackling the issues.  Txawm li cas los txhua yam yeej yuav nyob
hauv no tsis ploj.  I believe what some of you have eloquently stated.
Tus dev uas nws pheej dhia tas zog rau tus duab ntxoov ntxoo es tsis
zeemtseeb txog daim nqaij ntawm nws qhovncauj will end up losing.

My fellow SCH,
it has been a great lesson for me, since i was here!  i have learned
and became a custom many people wherever i may walked across, and to
understand the richness and poorest quality of human behaviors and
mentality. this had uplift my wisdom, knowledge, intellectual,
knowledge to another higher level. thanks to all of you, whether you
are the least expective or highly expective person.
next year, dr pao should come to july 4th or wisconsin labor fest to
celebrate SCH 11th year, with a tent over a table, so his colleauges
and friends would stop by to say hi.
