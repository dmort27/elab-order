MS,
why would they want to expose themselves of the high crimes against
humanity? with a few hmong people who help the VPDR (vietnam's puppet
democratic republic) cry 'fabrication' against all the evidences
collected/documented by both hmong and westerners, the VPDR can
continue to kill at will without accountability.
vim peb hmoob pheej muaj ib pab txeev siab pab VPDR thiaj zoo li no.
saib seb kuv hais li no kuv puas paub xwb, koj yawg... txhob khav khav
VPDR tsis pub muaj inspectors xwb; ib cov hmoob los kuj pom zoo yog
txhob muaj inspector tib yam thiab.
don't ask DKJ, why? (he seems a lightweight; nws twb teb tsis tau kuv
cov lus; nws hais lus xiav hlwb ua luaj li)
go ask vietnam and uncle sam, why not?
