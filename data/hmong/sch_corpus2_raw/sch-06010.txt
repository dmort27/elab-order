Tej nyuag xwm zej zog no ces tso siab rau koj lawm.  Koj hais yog.  The
race card is a dangerous card to play in Chai's case.  This is a hunter
versus other hunters. Chai Vang happened to be Hmong. That's all. Hmong
ain't Chinese, Koreans, nor Japanese. Hmong muaj nqis rau the U.S. ten
times that of these other Asians if we played the right card.
GVP would've said to you this way. Ya, "Nyob pem ko nrog xyuas nawb tej
nyuag teeb meem me, me lino xwb tsis tas kuv yuav tuaj."  I second!
