Please read the horrific news from Amnesty. Hmong people need to be
sick and tire of these sensless rapes and killings. How can we not
unite and stop the murderous intent to destroy the Hmong race?
When will the Hmong stand up. Stop being cowards - I have never seen a
race on earth so COWARD to achieve freedom for itself, always for
someone else.
Unite right NOW!
Come protest the killings on 9/18 at the capitol in St. Paul. We are
asking all Hmong in the United States to protest on the same date from
9am-12Pm at your respected capitol or town hall. If you need help
getting or how to get a demonstration permits let me know.

Laos: Military atrocities against Hmong children are war crimes
Amnesty International is horrified by recent reports, including video
evidence and witness testimony, of an attack by Lao soldiers against a
group of five children, four of them girls, in the Xaisomboune
military zone on 19 May 2004.
The children, aged between 13 and 16 years old and part of an ethnic
Hmong rebel group, were brutally mutilated -- the girls apparently
raped before being killed -- by a group of approximately 30-40
soldiers. The victims -- four girls, Mao Lee, 14; her sister Chao Lee,
16; Chi Her, 14; Pang Lor, 14; and Tou Lor, Pang Lor's 15 year old
brother -- were killed whilst foraging for food close to their camp.
They were unarmed.
The attacks violate the most fundamental principles of international
human rights and humanitarian law. These rapes and killings constitute
war crimes. The Lao authorities must bring to justice those
responsible for this atrocity and cease attacks on unarmed civilians.
A witness, who has subsequently fled the country and been recognized
as a refugee by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
reported hearing one of the soldiers saying: "Meo (Hmong). Your kael
ni (mouth) allows you to speak. Your hin (vagina) allows you to
breed".
He then heard moans and a gunshot.
Mao Lee was shot in each breast and the other bodies were mutilated by
what appears to be high-powered rifle shots fired at close range. One
of the girls was disembowelled.
Several other members of the group were seriously injured with gun
shot wounds but managed to return to their encampment. The rebels have
little if any medicine and rely on traditional treatments using plants
found in the forest.
The Lao authorities must, as a matter of utmost urgency, permit UN
agencies and independent monitors unfettered access to those rebels
who are recently reported to have 'surrendered'. They must also permit
humanitarian agencies to provide medical and food assistance to those
injured as a result of this and other military actions against the
rebels.
Background
The Hmong ethnic minority group in Laos was allied to the US during
the Viet Nam war and its spill-over fighting in both Laos and
Cambodia. The Hmong people have a long history of resistance and
aspirations of independence from Lao government control. Following the
creation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic in 1975 and the fall
of the former regime, as many as a third of the Hmong ethnic minority
are believed to have fled the country. Most of these refugees
resettled in the USA, but a large number spent many years in refugee
camps in Thailand.
Sporadic military resistance to the government has continued among
some ethnic groups, predominantly Hmong. There are also continuing
allegations of serious human rights abuses against those Hmong
perceived as still being opposed to the Lao government.
There have been increasing concerns over the last two years at an
apparent increase in Lao government military activity against rebel
groups, who along with armed adult men also comprise a large number of
women, children, elderly and sick. The upsurge in military activity
followed increasing international concern at the situation, which was
triggered by a number of journalists visiting rebel groups and
reporting their plight.
Credible sources have reported the deaths of scores of civilians,
mainly children, from starvation and injuries sustained during the
conflict. It is known that several of approximately 20 rebel groups
with their families are surrounded by Lao military and prevented from
foraging for food that they traditionally rely on to survive. Amnesty
International has protested to the Lao authorities at what it believes
is the use of starvation as a weapon of war against civilians.
Several hundred ethnic Hmong rebels are reported to have 'surrendered'
to the Lao authorities in recent months. UN agencies, diplomats and
journalists have not been given access to these people and Amnesty
International has received conflicting reports as to their reception
and treatment by the authorities.
Amnesty International has also repeatedly condemned indiscriminate
attacks by armed opposition groups that have reportedly killed and
injured civilians in Laos. Amnesty International unequivocally
condemns these acts and has and will continue to call upon the
perpetrators to cease all activities that are in violation of human
rights and international humanitarian law.
