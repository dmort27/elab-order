I have watched some of the Hmong movies.  Before they don't really
hold close to one another but now Hmong movies has become more
modernized, that is holding hands, holding to one another tightly,
sleep together, ib leeg tig los puag los khawm ib leeg thiab tseem
muaj kissing lawm thiab!  Wow!
I'm curious, yog nej tsis tau muaj txiv los yog muaj pojniam, would
you consider marrying a Hmong movie star uas twb muaj neeg muab nws
puag puag los lawm thiab perhaps twb muaj tug muab nws kiss los lawm?
Would you?  Why or why not?

Nkauj Mim,
That means Hmong has become a real movie star!  In any movie, there
are so many scenes - fighting, crying, yelling, kissing and even love
making.  People enjoy these types of movies.  Hmong movies are still
way far behind, well, I mean in terms of love making scenes.  I want
to see more of love scenes, perhaps a PG-13, I'm not ready for a R
rated or X rated yet.  Kuv hnov tias kuj muaj lawm thiab, tabsis tsis
tau pom dua.
Rau kuv xwb mas, tau xwb, tau kawg.  Yog kuv tus pojniam yog ib tug
movie star lawm ces nws yuav khawm petsawg leej los tsis ua cas, vim
nws tsuas yog act raws li qhov script thiab ua kom zaj movie ntawd lom
zem xwb.  Li cas los thaum los txog tsev ces nws yeej yog kuv tug
thiab yog txhua yam yog kuv li lawm.  Yog kiss li movie Hmoob xwb ces
tsuas kiss me...me... ntawm lub nyuas phlu xwb twb tsis yog hot kiss
ces tsis ua cas.
Tau Kawg.

This is my recommendation for any hmoob movie star or singer.
Yog koj tseem xav ua movie ces tsis txhob yuav txiv/pojniam kav tsis
ua koj cov dej num kom tiav tso. So too many of them have fight almost
any day. Tsis yog hmoob xwb, lwm yam tib neeg los yeej muaj teebmeem
ib yam thiab. Only few are realistickly flacible muaj family thiab
still act. If you choose this way let it be this way are much better
that you end up wonder what you going to do with your family.
I think peb hmoob niam qhuav pib meme xwb, our movie maker don't make
enought money to make it big yet, it was good but not yet perfect.

Tosli tej niag movie stars es sibnrauj pawg peslug nyob rau Hollywood
ces vim tej no ntag.  Nws mag lwmtus puag dhau los ces pheej xav tias
ntshe tseem muaj tus yuav haibdua thiab.  Sim lawm ces xav saj, saj
lawm ces xav noj ntag.
Hmong is falling into the trend and you can see these days many of our
Hmong singers, actors and actresses are not so far behind on being
famous, infamous, divorce, and other things.

Hmoob lub neej tseem mus tsis tau txog tej no. Yog peb yuam ua kom
hais tias yus ua tau thiab no ces yus txawm ua tau los yuav tsis phim
thiab tsis zoo li luag.
Thiab nws yuav tsis raug haiv neeg hmoob nyiam. Mam xyaum mam ua qhov
me me mus ua ntej tso, txhob rawm hla hlo mus.
