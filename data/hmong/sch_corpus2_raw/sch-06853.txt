THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, CLERGY, PARISHIONERS, IN SOME INSTANCE, HAVE SUPPORTED
STALKING, HARRASSMENT,
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE EAGAN LIBRARY, WITH SOME YOUNG MAN, COMING IN AMONGSTT THE
STALKING, RAPE HARRASSMENT, TO SAY THINGS IN A LOUD VOICE, IS THE EXACT SAME
THING, THAT PARISHIONERS, CLERGY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN,
STALKING IS GOING TO BE WRONG, ALL SHOULD GO TO POLICE,
BUT I WON'T POINT FINGERS, HOWEVER, I HOPE THE LIKES OF SHAINE, FR. JOHNSON,
CLARK, HART, ETC. LEAVE SOMEONE ALONE
AS WELL AS THE HMONG VANG GIRL, SINCE WOMEN, HAVE DECIDED, CRIMES, DON'T GIVE
SOMEONE ENOUGH RIGHTS TO MEET WOMEN,
TO LET IT BE SAID, THOSE LITTLE KIDS ON COLUMBUS CIRC LE, RETURNED TO SHOW
THEIR DISRESPECTFUYL HARRASSMENT OF LIFE,

Charlie,
You are obviously missing a lot of my sarcasm, but oh well...I am
honored that you would like to meet me in person, and I suppose that
time will come sooner or later.  But as for the apology, I already did
that so you needn't expect anymore--I am still waiting for you to
accept the first apology, and then apologize to me.  Here is a paj
huam I made for you.
Ua cas koj tseem zam txim tsis tau
Koj pheej kom kuv mob mob taub hau
Kuv twb mus nrog koj thov txim thiab
Tsis paub ua cas koj tsis kam hloov siab
Tsis ntev mam muaj ib hnub rau wb
Koj yuav pom tias koj yog tus swb
Txawm tias tsuas paub lus Hmoob me me
Kuv yeej ua tswv, koj ua tub qhev
Paj huam no kuv tsis hais ntxiv mus
Tsam koj mloog tas mam thov txim rau kuv nawj!
Xeng

TswvNtuj yeej muaj hwj huam thiab kev hlub loj heev thiaj txiav txim
rau cov "American Indians" kom yuav tsum ploj tag mus!

xeeb:
... You may call it sarcasism, but I work for Social Security and I've
seen your resemblence in those claimants with speech impaired. Peb cov
Hmoob noj nyiaj SSI ces hais lus li cov ntawd koj sau hauv no.  Roses
are red; violets are blue the sarcasism is best in you.  Ha! Ha! Ha!
Now that's sarcasism!
Charlie
