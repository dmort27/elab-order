Oh, yes, don’t worry I’ll make sure to use it daily to burn your deaf
ears.  If I could twist them, I would too.
Ua li cas koj hov qhia tsis tau haistias leejtwg kiag yog tus haistias
koj yuav go to hell?  Neeg nkawg xaiv ces zoo li no ntag lauv.  Hais
tau xwb tabsis prove tsis tau.  Yog lam tim ntsej tim muag hais mas
kuv saib koj lub me ntsej muag mas ntse yuav hloov mus ua liab lub
lawm.

lha,
kuv hlub koj ob lug niag qhov muag xwb os, npawg lem.  but, didn't i
say i am offering you something better?  what i'm offereing you is a
test of manhood and righteousness....too bad you are not man enough to
test it out.  do you know what this mean?  i'll let you figure it out.

by the way, koj lub ntsej muab ces, tsi yog liab dub xwb, koj ntsej
muag twb tuag tag lawm ne...koj thiaj li tsi take my offer ne....

notice that in your original message to you, you admitted that you
said it, but it is only a reiteration of the bible...now you're asking
me to name and point fingers....tejzaum koj ncauj zij lawm tiag pob,
es koj thiaj hais lus tom ntej tom qab li no pob?  los yog koj npam
dabtsi es vajtswv muab lub txim "lem" rua koj na?  ua neej nyob, hais
lus xob tom tom nplaig mas...
