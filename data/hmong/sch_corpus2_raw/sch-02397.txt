What's your opinion on Obama winning the Nobel peace prize?

I must say I am disappointed with this selection.  Not because Obama
won but because of the low criteria by which he won.  The Nobel should
be reserved for those who have contributed the most to the peace
process.  What tangible accomplishments have Obama done that warrants
this “cheapened” award?
