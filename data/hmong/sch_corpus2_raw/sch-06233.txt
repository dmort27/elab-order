HL....LOL! oh...man, pray god!
Her Lao, one thing in mind, as brother, you exposed yourself to the
forum, and other made comments on what you had said, then you should
digest it and learned from, and should not be defensive as you did to
Yawm Paaj, and go about comparison of Teev Lis. we should know within
oursleves that the main reason we posted in here is to draw an array of
opinions and comments from others, whether it is good or bad. we need
to resist with and try to understand where and why their comments are
the way there are.
here is my opinion, because you were very defensiveness toward those
are difference than you, or what you want to hear from and wish to
receive, that is why you shy away from Pojniam hmoob. a man of your
knowledge, skills, wisdom, and intelligence should have no problem in
dealing with these type of phenomeno. compassion and open mind to reach
across the world of trueness about how we can achieve within hmong men
and women are at your finger tips and your mind. i believe that it
should not take you a day to do research and learn them all, at that
time, you can melt these fears of your in a second. whether you are gay
or not, it is your own personal life. but when a person becomes
defensive among things he does not wish to hear or like--these things
must hit them right in the nerves, to be able to come up with that hard
feelings. be gentle as you write and your wisdom of math and science,
these will cure and do the trick for you as for women of any race.
i have a consin who is older than you, he now married to another lady
in Laos. he just came back about a month ago. i told my uncle with
these words, ( kuv hais rau hais tias, tsi yog kuv tij laug Gay os, nws
mus ua neeg zoo lawm xwb, es thiaj li tsi muaj kev txob kev
txhawj--nyob ib leeg kajsiab lug tag ib sim neej xwb os).  vim li cas
cov txiv neej no thiaj li tham tsi tau hlua nkauj hmoob thiab tsi paub
nrog hlua nkauj hmoob sib tham.  vim lawv lub siab luv luv, thiab coj
kiag li nws hais thiab nws xav tau xwb. coj li no, ces nws easy to go
with the white women mas, tabsi nws coj los tsi haum cov pojniam hmoob
li ne.  tsi tag li xwb, nws twb phem npaum li ntawv los, nws tseem xaiv
xaiv pojniam thiab--yuav tsom cov zoo zoo nkauj thiab xwb, ces thaum
nws mus nrog lawv hais lus, ces lawv los yog neeg twmtswb los yog
twmxeeb ib yam li nws thiab ces. yeej tsi muaj ib los lus haum thiab
nkag siab li aws. hahhahahhaha ***@Zhen, thiab Yawm Paaj, hais tias,
yawm aws, cov no mas tsi yog ncauj qabzib nplaig qabntsev li kuv me
yawm lawv li nev...hhahahaha! kuv tus tijlaug no, kuv nrog tham kiag
xwb, yuav ua li cas hais tias yog hlua nkauj, kuv kiag es siab ntev
thiab zoo npaum li no, kuv twb cias li ntshai nws li lawm es.....yog
zoo npaum li kuv no twb ntshais lawm ces, txhua tus pojniam hmoob yeej
tsi kam nws txav tis li ***@yawm Paaj.
tabsi kuv believe hais tias, yog Her Lao mus lawm Thailand and Nplog
teb nav, mas nws yeej yov yuav tau pojniam hmoob thiab nyiam pojniam
hmoob xwb--yeeb vim cov pojniam tim ub lawv tseem ntshaws cov txiv neej
hmoob tim no heev, ces lav yuav tsi hais lus siab thiab tsi kam sib cam
nrog tus txiv neej ntawv li kuv tus tijlaug no los yog HerLao. cov
ntxhais teb chaws no, lawv tsi take koj easy lawm--yog cov yuav take
koj easy ces yog cov ua "dem dawg ntshij" li Her Lao hais lawm xwb mas,
thiaj li yuav tsi hais dabtsi rov rau HL lawm.
tos kuv hais tias, sib tham kiag xwb ces yws twb paub hais tias tus
neeg no tus cwjpwm coj li cas, yog zaum zoo hais los hais, saum tsi zoo
hais lus los, cias li hais li no ces, nws tsi last ntev rau yus lus
homphiaj li....ua kev phoojywg os thiab yuav ua niam txiv
***@Paaj.
ntau dhau hwv lawm, next time mam li tham dluas
