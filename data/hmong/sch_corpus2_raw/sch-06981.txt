Charlie,
I got someone on fire again, huh!  Charlie, tej laus keev hais tais
"nyuj muaj nyuj kab, nees muaj nees kev" tiam sis yog yus tsis txhawj
taug kom ncaj ces yus pheej mus tshuam kab nyuj dhau kev nees ces yog
koj ntag yawg.
Why are you hiding your words and close your mouth?  You have the
opportunity to say anything you want.  Thiab tej laus hais tias "noj
tsis taus yuav tuag, hais tsis taus yuav swb" now it's your turn to do
it, or you are too chicken.
Your statement below indicated that I should be involved with all the
murders in Thailand and Laos, right?  Why not you just say straight to
point that you want to say instead of going around the skin.  You can
be right that I was part of the killing but you know sooner or later
the international justice will tell who responsible for all the
killings.  Don't worry, your words is more powerful than who you are.
Charlie, yog yam yus tsis tau ua ces leej twg hais li cas los tsis
kaus yus tawv li.  Tiam sis yog tias yus tau ua lawm ces txawm lawv me
me xwb los twb ntaub ntaub yus pob kub lawm, puas yog?  Guess who is
that person?
