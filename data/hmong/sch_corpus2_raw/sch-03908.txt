tsujsua,
are you sure the av-puam (apple) was lub paum? that means that nkauj
iab (eve) ntxias tau nruag oo (adam) noj paum?
that means that ntuj tsim tej raug txiv neej yeej txawj noj paum lawm?
and here some of you thought it was vaajmung's style.
but i don't agree with your interpretations of the metaphors. snake =
qau, av-paum = paum. no way. then that means rab qau (snake) ntxias
nkauj iab noj paum (av-paum). nkauj iab noj paum tag ces nraug oo
tseem siv raug dag noj paum thiab? tswv ntuj tsis pub nkawv noj lub
paum vim tias yog noj paum lawm ces yuav paub cuag li tswv ntuj?
but, maybe you have a point. because cov txiv neej
'intellectuals' (cov khav tias lawv paub cuag li tswv ntuj) hauv no
tsuas txawj tham txog noj paum ntau xwb tsi sub.
