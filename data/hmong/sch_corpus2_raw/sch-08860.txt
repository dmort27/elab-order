but....in summary, i still don't understand your comment.  are you
saying
that people of "engineer" status should not stick to the "old" things?
yaweh
Sorry,  I was out working all day and haven't had time to chat with
you.  Generally, people who don't believe in gods or any religion don't
necessary believe in "Dlaab" and hmong funeral rites. They also don't
care much about hmong wedding tradions so long as there a wedding to
declare the union of 2 people. They are the easy folks to get along
with. Their opinions are not so strong.  You seem to be the exception.
