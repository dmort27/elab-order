I came across this...by Wilkinson.  It needs "not a course, a lecture,
or a book...[it] is to take people out of their safe environment and
away from the people they knew, and throw them into a new arena they
know little about.  Way over their head, preferably.  In fact, the
more demanding their challenges, the more pressure and risk they face,
the more likely a dynamic leader will emerge."
