Scratching my head...not sure what you're saying???  As far along as I
have been on this forum, I have not wrongly acused of Hmong men for
anything except phua ncaj ncaj hauv nruab nrab saib ncaj ncaj taug qab
xwb na...:))

Lajntxiag,
when i said that there are always someone who is volunteering to be a
victim is that when a woman get beat up by her boy friend or
husband--she is not leaving him or goes to a shelter. even after the
meeting with many experts, she is volunteering herself to go back to
the abuser, and that happens lots--so i conclude that she is
volunteering to be the victim by herself.  it would be in a similarity
to the man too, many times, a wife abuses him with verbal and restrict
his freedom, but he is volunteering himself freely to go back to her in
his own free will.
ib yam li tus pojniam ua tus txiv twb muab ntau ntau sab sab, es twb
khiav mus nyob rau shelter los yog lwm qhov chaws lawm, nws tseem nco
tus txiv dhau hwv lawm--tsi tsum lub siab li, rov qab mus es tus txiv
