TO THOSE FEW SMART ASS STUDENTS ANTI VP.
WHATEVER VP DID HE DOES ACCORDINGLY TO US POLICY,WHETHER YOU THINK IT
IS RIGHT OR WRONG TO YOU. WHATEVER HE DID HE KNOW WHAT HE DO AND HE
KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO GET ADVICE FROM, HE KNOW THE RIGHT CHANNEL TO GO.
HE HAS MORE GOOD WHITE LEADERS FRIENDS THAN WE THOUGHT HE HAS. IN MY
OWN OPINION VP HAS EVERY RIGHT (ALL RIGHTS) TO ASK FOR HMONG DONATIONS
AS LONG AS HE LIVE, WHETHER IT BE 1 TIME OR 1000 TIMES. JUST LIKE ANY
LEADER IN THE USA DOES.
JUST BECAUSE YOUR DUMB ASS CAN NOT ASK FOR (get) ANY DONATION FROM THE
HMONG COMMUNITY AND YOU ARE SO PISS OFF. SORRY CAN'T HELP.  I REPEAT...
WHATEVER VP DID HE DOES ACCORDINGLY TO US POLICY.

WITH NO DOUBT.  VP WILL ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS TO ANYONE, ANY GROUP,
OPPSITION PERSON/GROUP WHEN HE FEEL APPROPRIATE TO ANWSER.
