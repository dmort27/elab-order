Phooj ywg Hmoob, hais txog teeb meem ntawm cov Hmoob los nyob Dej Dawb.
Kuv kuj tsis paub ntau tab sis kuv muaj ob tug muam kuj los nyob rau
hauv thiab. Kuv kuj tau pab txog li ntawn $500 nyiaj mus rau nkawv muas
noj rau lub sij hawm uas nkawv tseem nyob hauv Dej Dawb. Ua ntej kuv
yuav xa nyiaj mus, kuv tau hu xov tooj mus nrog nkawv tham(believe it
or not they did have cell phone with them...) thiab nug nkawv tias yog
vim licas neb ho khiav tuaj nyob txom nyem ntsuav rau hauv no...? Nkawv
teb kuv tias..."cov niag Hmoob pheej dag tias, kav tsij khiav tuaj mus
Thaib Teb thiaj tau mus Mekas..." Kuv nrog nkawv tham tau ib xuab moos
txog kev nyob thiab noj haus hauv Dej Dawb. Kuv yeej nug txog ntawm cov
paj lug cua uas hnov tias muaj cov los tim hav zoov los nyob hau thiab
no puas muaj tiag. Nkawv yeej hais meej meej tias cov neeg ntawv yeej
muaj tiag(197 leej). Tsis tag li ntawv, kuv tus txiv ntawm uas yog
Hmoob nplog mus ua Hmoob Thaib tau 20 lub xyoo los lawm, nws tus kheej
los yeej hais tias nws yeej mus pom cov Hmoob ntawv thiab.
...so what am I trying to get across? Politic or not, I certainly not
taking sides here, but from what I heard an audio tape recorded by
Laura Xiong, it gave me a creep.... I have  a very cold feeling toward
Hmoob 18 xeem. I do agree that Laura certainly was being too honest
about those Hmoob who came to Dej Dawb, but maybe because what she was
trying to  do was helping those who truely and desperatly needed help,
NOT those who were in search  for a better life. The war end 30 years
ago, the only people who needed help are those still in the jungle
running for their lives. I personally don't like the attitude of what
could be Hmoob 18 xeem or who ever the man on that audio tape. My
question is so you want to be my leader or should I say...."a Hmoob
leader" this is all you got! threatening against some one life? Com
on!... what kind of a politic are playing here? who do you think you
are? So if you kill Laura Xiong would that make you a bigger man or a
better Hmoob leader? You all want to take credit for saving a Hmoob
life but acting like bunch stupid low life scums. Do your self a
favorite, who ever made a call to threatening Laura's life, give her a
call to apoligy and perhaps you all should work togethers instead of
fighting for your own stupid ego...
