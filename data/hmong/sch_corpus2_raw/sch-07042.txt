I HAVE THE SAME PROBELME LIKE YOU. AND I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA TO
IMPROVE IT TOO.  WHEN I WAS IN THAILAND THERE WAS A, MY, HMONG TEACHER
HE TOUGHT FRECNH HAUV XOOM VINAI, HE CAME UP WITH A WAY THAT IT IS
VERY EASY TO READ AND CAN READ FASTER THAN THOSE WE USE NOWADAY. HE
ACTUALLY WROTE A STORY AND USING HIS NEW METHODOLOGY (NEW
MODIFICATION) I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE OR WHAT COUNTRY HE LEFT FOR. NEW
YOG PEB COV KWVTIJ HMOOB "XEEM LEE" THIAB MAS. I SIMPLY DON'T RECALL
HIS NAME. HE COULD WRITE A PAGE IN FRENCH TELL A STORY ABOUT HOW THE
PATHET LAO TAKE OVER LAOS AND TRANSLATE IT INTO HIS NEW HMONG VERSION
(HIS MODIFICATION). WE COULD READ IT FAST AND EASY. BUT I AM ALL
FORGOT NOW. I THINK NOW HE IS IN BETWEEN 48 TO 60. AND I MISS HIM.

Muaj ib zag dabneeg Hmoob hu ua, "Uablag thiab lub Taubdej."
A thirsty Crow found a Pitcher with some water in it, but so little
was there, that try as he might, he could not reach it with his beak,
and it seemed as he would die of thirst.  At last he hit upon a clever
plan.  He started dropping pebbles into the Pitcher of water, and with
each pebble the water level rose a little higher until at last it
reached the brim, and the knowing bird was able to to quench his
thirst.
Lub ntsiab lus yog, necessity is the mother of invention.
Tamsim no ntawd Hmoob tsis muaj nqis ces peb ntsia zoo li nyuab heev.
Tabsis hnub twg yog peb sau tau ib phau ntawd Hmoob es tau tsheej
million dollars xwb ces hnub ntawd koj yuav tsis muaj question li
lawm.  Ntawd Hmoob haj yam yooj yim.  Qhov koj nyeem tsis tau nrawm
vim yog Hmoob tus ntawd yeej tsis nyob rau koj lub siab thiab koj tsis
tau zoo li tus Uablag no es koj thiaj nyeem qeeb.
I could be wrong tabsis lam hais rau nej xav....

Vilicab,
Tej zaum kuv paub tus koj hais ntawd...seb nws puas yog tus ua lub
koom haum Hmoob hauv Vinai xwb?  Niaj hnub no nws tseem nyob Thaib
Teb.  Nws qhov version thiaj yog qhov real Hmong script.

Kuv xav mas yuav kom nyeem tau zoo thiab nrawm mas koj yuav tsum paub
cov txheej txheem ntawv RPA kom zoo heev mas koj thiaj nyeem tau zoo
thiab nrawm.  Kuv tsis paub nej li cas hos kuv ses kuv nyeem ntawv
Hmoob thiab sau ntawv Hmoob muaj tej thaum kuv tseem tau suav ntivtes
saib tus cim yog tus twg qhov no twb ua rau kuv qeeb lawm ntau.  Phau
ntawv zoo nyeem thiab muaj ntau tshaj yog "Haiv Liv Xwm" by Wu Ronjee
(Vue Zoov Tsheej) from China.  Phau ntawv no kuv nyiam nyeem heev vim
nws muaj cov information uas kuv ib txwm tsis tau paub li.
Tom,

Nws TSIS YOG TUS KOJ HAIS NO OS KOJ YAG, TUS KOJ HAIS UA KOOM HAUM NO
MAS YOG LIS TXAIS OV. TUS KUV HAIS NO MAS TEJ ZAUM NWS YUAV UA LIS
TXAIS TIJ ME NTSIS & NWS SIAB DUA LIS TXAIS, TUS PLHU YUAG NKIB, MUAJ
POB TXIG & PALUB HAUS CAWS TSIM TSAWV. I WILL CALL MY NEPHEW IN
SACRAMENTO, CA TO FIND OUT MAYBE HE STILL REMEMBER HIS NAME, IF HE CAN
THEN WE CAN START TO ASKING PEOPLE IN EVERY STATE/COUNTRY AROUND TO
LOCATE HIM BRING TO ONBOARD WITH US.
