phooj ywg tou,
you know it. i don't deny that. i would never say such things to you
because you carry yourself differently from uncle tseemyeej. but
nevertheless, i employ such pathetic words b/c it works on tseemyeej.
old, but still useful.
yeah, by the end of spring. kuv mam li hu/sau koj. tiam si xyov li as,
kuv tau cem nej coob leej ntau tus ib tsam ces koj ho muab kuv ntsev
cuav ned? hahahahahaha. tso dag xwb.
it's nothing new that i have not already heard. kuv lam hais kom ua
intervention rau uncle tseemyeej kom nws txhob ua haib haib rau peb s/
d xwb. zoo li kuv cheem tau nws, tiam si, zoo li nws cheem tsis tau
kuv. yog tias uncle tseemyeej cheem raws qhov nruab nrab kuv yeej
yuav, tiam si, nws tseem tsis tau paub tias nws hais ib sab tom me
ntsis lawm. in time, i suppose, we'll come to sincere respect.
