I cannot pasted it now, but my all time favorite song is Tou Ly
Vangkhue's "Xav kom rov yog 18 dua..." such as sad/happy song for all
over to 18 to thinking about...
"...kuv xav kom kuv rov qab yog 18 xyoo...kuv xav kom kuv rov qab yog
18 xyoo...
What is ur favorite song? Â Mine is the story of my life.
