This is very interesting topic. A few thoughts for us to think about
tribalism.
Back in 1990, one of my professor said this to me, "Do you know why
there was no peace in Africa?" I told him, "I don't know", then he said
"Because of tribalism." Ces kuv cia li ua twbywm lawm xwb, rau qhov kuv
totaub tias nws xav li cas, thiab kuv mam xeev txog kuv tus kheej
(Hmong).
Muaj dua ib zaug, kuv ho hnov ib tug professor hais li no, "Lost tribe,
lost knowledge" Kuv saib saib mas nws kuj yog kawg li thiab. Peb Hmoob
tej tshuaj ntsuab, tav tsuj sua (thaum muaj ib tug mob taubhau thiab
mob ib ce rau tej leeg heev heev zoo li taubhau yuav tawg yuav tawg,
peb hu tias mob tsuj sua no. Yog cov paub tav tsuj sua ces nws npaws
thiab xais tamsim ces tus ntawd cia li zoo), txhuam ceeb, Hmong
classical language, proverbs and other suvival knowledges & etc. Koj
xav li cas?
This is a new knowledge I just discovered a year ago, "Leadership is
tribal and art, not scientific."
Hope tias yog peb txawj xaiv (understand) tej yam zoo uas peb Hmoob ib
txwd yeej muaj nrog peb plus what we learn from the west, we are the
top. Thanks.
