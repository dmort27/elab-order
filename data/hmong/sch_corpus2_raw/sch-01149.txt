CHINA MADE A GOOD MOVE. SHE CAN AFFORD TO DO IT BECAUSE SHE HAS FUNDS.
SPENDING 12% ON R&D IS BIG.
DOES CHINA STILL HAVE CRONYISM ISSUE? MAYBE NOT ANYMORE. A MORE
INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED WORK FORCE WITH LESS IDEOLOGY WILL TRANSLATE
INTO A FASTER PACE OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE COUNTRY.
BY THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY, CHINA IS EXPECTED TO BE A FULL-FLEDGED
SUPER POWER.
