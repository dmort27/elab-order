SYS,
You know what? an old lady came to my store and said this:
-" Ua lawv tsaug os me tub...Yog lawv tsis ntuas koj ua luaj no
ces ntshe koj lub neej twb tsis zoo li no os mog." Then she left.
-"...huh????" Astonished, I stood there speechless for a long moment...
Life is too short, my wife is too beautiful, so many places yet  to be
explored....
