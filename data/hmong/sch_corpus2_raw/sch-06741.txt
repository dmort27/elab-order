Xf. Wayne Yang,
This is what the young want us to know, but we also want them to know
that we do love them deeply until death due.  All parents want to see
the good of our kids instead the ugly.  We them thing because we love
and care about them.
What about yam lawv ntshai tshaj yog dabtsi?  Yog muaj neeg teb lawm
kuv mam li qhia qhov kuv tau hnov thaum cov hluas tham ntawm kuv tshev
rau nej.  Nws yeej txaus luag thiab tiam yeej muaj tseeb rau nws txoj
kev ntshaw.
