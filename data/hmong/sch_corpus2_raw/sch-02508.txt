IS AFFAIR STARTED BY THE WOMAN OR THE MAN?
HOW DOES AN AFFAIR GET STARTED?
CAN YOU HAVE AN AFFAIR EMOTIONALLY (WITH GETTING PHYSICAL)?

Tej Laus niaj txis piv lus tias MAUM DEV tsis co tw TXIV DEV tsis lam
nce.......   Yog yus paub tias yus muaj txiv lawm yeej tsis muaj tus
lam zes tau yus....  Tiam sis yog tus nws muaj txiv los nim ua me
hehehe hom hom hom ces tsis ntev mag lawm los mas......!

SO, ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT'S THE WOMAN WHO STARTED THE AFFAIR?
NOW, LET'S BE REAL.  LET'S LOOK AT CASES THAT HAPPENS AT WORK. 75% OF
ALL AFFAIRS HAPPENED AT THE WORK PLACE.
NOW, ARE YOU SAYING THAT AT WORK THE WOMAN IS THE ONE WHO INITIATED
THE AFFAIR?  ISN'T IT THE MAN WHO ALWAYS STARTED THE CONVERSATION, OR
LOOK AT THE WOMAN DIFFERENTLY, OR TRYING TO PLEASE THE WOMAN AT FIRST?
HMONG ALWAYS USE THE "MAUM DEV CO TW" BUT IN REALITY, IS THAT ALWAYS
THE CASE?  TO ME, AN AFFAIR ALWAYS STARTED BY THE MAN.  HE LOOKS, HE
LIKES, HE LUST, HE LOVES AND THEN HE LEAVES HER SOMETHING TO PONDER
FIRST.  THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.

4ever aw!
Pib ntawm nej cov niag poj niam tiaj las as.  Hmoob twb hais ib lo lus
hais tias  "poj niam ua qaib qua ces ntxia tau txiv neej sawv los sib
tua no nev!  Thaum twg nej cov niag poj niam hais tias "ua tsis tau
ces tsis yog txivv neej" no ces mag txiv neej xyuas kiag xwb mas

I KNOW YOU MEN ARE FOR THE MEN.  BUT I THINK YOU GUYS ARE NOT FAIR AND
NOT STICKING TO THE TRUTH.
OK, IF A MAN WALKS TO A WOMAN AND TOUCH HER, HOW CAN YOU SAY SHE
STARTED IT?  IT'S THE MAN WHO WALKS UP TO THE WOMAN!  SHE CAN ONLY
RESPOND TO WHAT THE MAN DID, EITHER TO SAY SOMETHING OR NOT SAYING
ANYTHING.
SEE, YOU MEN LIKE TO LABEL WOMAN AND BLAME THE WOMAN FOR ANYTHING BUT
IF ALL WOULD JUST SIT IN THEIR OWN SEATS THEN NOTHING WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED.

Although some have more control than others, given the right time,
right person, and right place, any person will cheat...it is a
naturally thing to do.  the question of "leejtwg pib ua ntej"....qhov
no ces...twb yog 2 leeg pib uantej mas.  temsis, tus txiv neej yog tus
ua muab ntxig nplo rau laiv....ho pojniam mas, pw zoo zoo mloog with
anticipation xwb, unless of coruse, the woman taakes charge.
maumdev txawm co tw heev npaum cas los yog tus txiv neej tsi kam ua
thiab tsi xav ua, los yog tsi muaj lub mentality yuav mus ua, nws yeej
tsi ua li.  pojniam los tib yam thiab...vim li no, 2 leeg pib tibtxhij
at the right time ces....muaj affair xwb.
yaweh

Qhov no mas ib txhia hais tias yog "affair of the eyes."  Nkawd txawm
tsis tau sib kov los yog tsis muaj physical touch los nkawd ob lub
qhov muag twb muaj affair lawm.  Ob lub qhov muag ntawd twb sib daj
sib dee tag lawm.  Koj puas paub, thaum nkawd sib daj sib dee hauv
nkawd ob lub qhov muag xwb twb ua rau nkawd zoo nyob na!  There's a
feeling of satisfaction or hunger for more nyob rau hauv lub nruab
plaw tuaj.  Qhov ntawd ces thiaj li ua rau nkawd nrhiav sijhawm mus
sib kov kom tau - begins with kissing and then caressing and then in
bed.
So, yes, you can have an affair without getting physical.  Like now,
some people here are fantasizing about you!
