Nyob zoo cov phoojywg!  How's everyone doing?  It's been awhile now
that I haven't come in here to exchange ideas with you all.  Hopefully
everyone is doing well; hopefully everyone is not flexing muscles at
each other as before?  Hopefully not.  We all should respect each
other, even if we disagree on certain issues.  Peb Hmoob yuav tsum sib
hlub, sib pab, thiab koom ua ib lub siab, peb thiaj li yuav muaj kev
vammeej rau lawm yav tom ntej.  Yog leejtwg tsis paub txog dabtsi, cov
paub yuav tsum qhib lub siab dawb pawg mus pab.  Txoj kev sib khib
thiab sib ntxub, thov muab tso pov tseg.  Yog leejtwg ua tau dabtsi
zoo, peb sawvdaws yuav tsum pab nws zoo siab thiab pab txhawb nws
zog.  Peb yuav tsum tsis txhob muaj txoj kev khib, thiab txhob nrhiav
kev muab nws txo.  Vam thiab cia siab tias lub xyoo tshiab los no mus
rau lawm yav tom ntej, peb sawvdaws yuav los taug txoj kev zoo uas tau
hais los no.
Aside from that note, do you guys like to watch Hmong movies?  What
are your personal views about Hmong movies?  My wife and I just
produced a movie entitled, "Desperate Love, Bitter Longing / Hlub Ceev
Ceev, Tso Nyuaj Nyuaj," which will be released at the Hmong new year
in St. Paul, MN, Nov. 27-29th, 2009.  We will also be at the Fresno
Hmong New Year celebration in December 2009.  So, if you have time, do
please stop by to check us out and support us.  You can go view the
trailer to our movie at:  www.youtube.com/yellowrentertainment.  I
hope to meet you guys there!
Have a great day, and love each other always!  "Make Love, Not War"!
