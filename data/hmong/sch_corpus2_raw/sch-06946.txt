TO ALL HMONG BRO AND SIS
I THINK EVERYONE CAN USE AS MANY SCREEN NAME AS S/HE WANTED AND BE
ABLE TO REMEMBER HIS/HER OWN SCREEN NAMES AND PASSWORDS, THERE IS NO
LIMITED OF HOW MANY SCREEN NAME WE CAN OR CAN'T USE. AS LONG AS WE
DON'T STEAL ANYBODY ELSE SCREEN NAME AND PASSWORD THERE SHOULD BE NO
PROBLEM, THE INTERNET HAS A LOT OF ROOM FOR US TO POOP.
