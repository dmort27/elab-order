INSTEAD?

THE DAMAGE OF "TSHUM" HAS BEEN DONE!  WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESOLVE IT
BUT LEARN FROM IT AND WE CAN DISSOLVE IT BY NOT TSHUM.

Xejthim & Ya,
I thought bawg Tshua nej yog old friends thiab yog cov OG hauv midwest
nov no. Tiam sis mloog nej cov posting/exchanges mas zoo li nej tsis
xav sib pom li lawm.
Ya, es koj mus tom Tire Town rov los mus tsev es koj yeej tsis take US
I-75 north los mus saib bawg Tshua li lawm los?
LP yeej yog bawg Tshua tus kwv tus tij tiam sis cov committee yog cov
txiav txim. LP wb tsuas yog cov committee ntawv tej tes tej taw khaiv
xwb....
Thov nco tias "...boj yaig tsis txawm tawm txim li lub ncaig..."
Tsis tag li xwb thov caw nej & tej phooj ywg xa nej li ABSTRACTS
tuaj... the deadline is November 30th, 2005.
