Cov phoojywg Moob suavdlawg,
Mej xaav le caag yog thaum GVP hab cov associates nraug tso tawm lug
without verdit vim Nploglab tua Moob tuag coob tshaaj qhov U.S Justice
Dept accused GVP hab cov associates tas puab yuavx phom, missile, and
other weapon moog tua Nploglab.
Cov left wing idea xaav le caag? es cov right wing idea ne?. Qhov nuav
tsi tau mean tas left wing ces yog traitor or associated with LPDR but
we should have left & right in order to balance the power. Only one
wing cannot fly and unable to balance the body,power, in Hmong/Mong
community or elsewhere.
Thanks,
MT
