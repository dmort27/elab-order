There are too many process to bring Hmong to oversea, not just only VP
so everyone have the opportunity.  The Hmong is the major key issue of
the open door.  Yog tsi muaj pejxeem, vaj ntxwv yeej tsi muaj qab
hau.  King Solomon said, there is no population the king is nothing.
There more people the king have more power.
Tsi muaj Hmoob VP tsi lam tau ua nom ib zaug.  Txawm Vp yuav txawj
yuav ntse yuav txawj ya los yog tsi muaj Hmoob yawg yeej tsi tau ua
nom.  This is the key and the main poin.  Txhob saib tom ntsis xwb maj
cov yawg, saib lub hauv paug thiab maj.  Muaj hauv paug thiaj muaj
ntsis nav.
Vp yeej ua tau ntau yam zoo pab Hmoob lawm, qhov no yeej muaj tseeb
tiamsis Hmoob yeej pab thiab txhawb VP ntau yam los lawm nws thiaj
muaj koob muaj npe thiaj ciaj nom.  Is not VP along can achieve every
thing but Hmong with the help of CIA.  Without VP there still Hmong
and CIA okay think about it but without Hmong and CIA there no VP.  Do
not give all the credit to VP, we should give credit to our father,
brother, love one who die to help CIA and VP.
