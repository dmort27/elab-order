Koj twb ntse thiab sav, ua cas yuav lam tau lam nug tej lo lus dag dag
li no no?  It's the same thing as Hmong, man--it's only a different
spelling of Hmong.  And you know this yourself.  Don't make a fool of
yourself, aight?

Brandon,
I simply think that adding any further spelling to the word "Hmong"
will not bring us anything positive or move us up one or more levels.
Instead it will divide us further and bring us down. The more you
intellectuals debate the more confused I become. Kuv xaam tsi pum tas
ntxiv lu lug Mong rua huv qaab lu lug Hmong los yog muab lu lug Mong
cais tawm ntawm lu lug Hmong nuav yuav zoo dlaab tsi rua peb.
Yuav moog muab ib lu lug cais los phua lu lug kws yog lub npe rua haiv
neeg Hmoob nyob qaab ntuj khwb tawm sis tseem siv lu lug tas peb yog
ib haiv neeg sib tshwj sib cais tsi tau (one society indivisible) mas
tsi make sense rua kuv le os.
