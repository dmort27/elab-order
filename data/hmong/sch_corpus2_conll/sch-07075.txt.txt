I
WILL

AND
THAT
WILL
BE
THE

OF
IT

THEN
GO
RIGHT
AGHEAD
AND
KEEP
ON
MISSING
THE
TARGET
AS
YOU
DID
THIS
PASS
FEW
DAYS
...
THAT
WOULD
ONLY
SHOW
THAT
THE
``
GREAT
LOGICAL
LAO
''
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
FOOL
...
OFF
THE
SUBJECT
...
IGNORE
THIS
IF
YOU
CA
N'T
UNDERSTAND
THE
ANALOGY
.


WHEN
A
WOMAN
TOUCHES
YOUR
CROTCH
...
THAT
USUALLY
MEANS
SHE
IS
READY
TO
PERFORM
SOME
SORT
OF
SEXUAL
ACT
WITH
YOU
.


WHEN
SHE
GOES
DOWN
ON
YOU
,
THAT
USUALLY
MEANS
SHE
IS
``
ALMOST
''
THERE
TO
2ND
OR
THIRD
BASE
WITH
YOU
.


MY
ADVICE
IS
,
STICK
TO
THE
SEXUAL
ACT
,
INSTEAD
OF
TALKING
ABOUT
LAO
TZU
,
OR
PLATO
,
OR
``
TALE
OF
TWO
CITIES
''
WHEN
SHE
'S
DOING
U
A
FAVOR
.


MY
POINT
IS
,
YOU
BROUGHT
UP
ABSURDITY
IN
PAO
'S
ORIGINAL
STATEMENT
.


NOW
,
IT
IS
TIME
FOR
YOU
TO
USE
LOGIC/COMMON
SENSE/EDUCATION/SCIENCE
TO
BACK
UP
YOUR
CLAIM
...
WE
ALL
KNOW
THAT
THE
SHORTEST
DISTANCE
BETWEEN
TWO
POINTS
IS
A
STRAGHT
LINE
...
NOW
IT
IS
TIME
FOR
YOU
TO
USE
THIS
LOGIC
AND
TELL
ME
WHY
IT
IS
'ABSURD
'
AS
YOU
SAID
.


BY
THE
WAY
,
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
``
UNSUPPORTED
,
ILLOGICAL
CLAIMS
''
AND
``
LOGICAL
REASONONG
''
FOR
CLAIMS
.


CAN
YOU
DIFFERENTIATE
THE
TWO
?

PERHAPS
DURING
THIS
HOT
TEMPERED
TIME
,
I
FAILED
TO
REALIZED
WHICH
COMMENT
I
MADE
...
PLEASE
,
DO
POINT
OUT
...
MAYBE
I
COULD
CLEAR
IT
UP
...
MAYBE
I
WAS
WRONG
...
BUT
IF
I
'M
WRONG
,
THEN
OF
COURSE
,
LIKE
ANY
MAN
,
I
WILL
ADMIT
TO
IT
.


I
'M
NOT
LIKE
LAUJ
,
WHO
MAKES
ALOT
OF
CLAIMS
,
BUT
FAIL
TO
SUPPORT
THOSE
CLAIMS
.


BUT
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW
THAT
,
USUALLY
THE
MAIN
PARTIES
OF
AN
ARGUMENT
SOMETIMES
FAILED
TO
SEE
THEIR
``
FAULTINESS
.
''


SO
I
DO
ENCOURAGE
YOU
TO
POINT
OUT
WHAT
I
SAID
THAT
SEEM
TO
BE
OFFENSIVE
.
