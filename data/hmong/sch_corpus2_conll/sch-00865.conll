THE
LPDR
LEADERS
ARE
MILLIONAIRES
AND
BILLIONAIRES
.


SCHOOL
IS
NOT
THE
IMPORTANT
ISSUE
FOR
THEM
.


IF
THEM
WANT
THE
COUNTRY
TO
BE
SMART
AND
HAVING
ENOUGH
TECHNICAL
KNOW-HOW
THEY
COULD
USE
A
FEW
OF
THOSE
HOUSE
FULL
MONEY
TO
CREATE
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
ADVANCE
AND
BEST
SCHOOL
ON
EARTH
.


BUT
THAT
IS
NOT
THEIR
INTENTION
AND
DESIRE
THEREFORE
NOTHING
LIKE
THATIS
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
.


THEY
PREFER
THE
CITIZENS
TO
BE
STUPID
AND
EASY
TO
CONTROL
.


IF
THE
CITIZENS
GOT
SMARTER
THEY
ARE
MUCH
MORE
LIKELY
TO
RESIST
GOVERNMENT
CONTROL
OR
MANAGEMENT
.


SO
SPENDING
A
FEW
HOUSES
FULL
OF
MONEY
TO
CREATE
SCHOOL
IS
THE
OPPOSITE
OF
THEIR
DESIRES
.


THOSE
LPDR
LEADERS
ARE
SMART
ENOUGH
TO
KNOW
WHAT
WILL
UNWRAP
THEIR
IRON
GRIP
OF
THE
CITIZENS
AND
WHAT
WILL
KEEP
THE
CITIZEN
UNDER
CONTROL
.


LETS
GIVE
AN
EXAMPLE
LPDR
HAD
BEEN
KILLING
CITIZENS
FOR
DECADES
YET
LITTLE
OR
NO
NEWS
LEAK-OUT
INTO
THE
WORLD
OF
INTERNATIONALS
.


HOW
MANY
COUNTRIES
CAN
DO
IT
LIKE
THAT
?


DO
NOT
EVEN
MENTION
THE
KILLING
AND
TORTURE
OF
PEOPLE
.


IF
ONE
OF
US
TRY
TO
TEACH
A
DOG
A
LESSON
THE
DOG
WILL
SCREAM
AND
HOWL
SO
LOUD
THAT
THE
WHOLE
VILLAGE
WILL
KNOW
YOU
ARE
BEATING
THE
DOG
.


LPDR
IS
SMART
TO
SQUEEZE
THE
CITIZENS
NUTS
YET
KEEP
THE
CITIZEN
SILENCE
FROM
INTERNATIONAL´S
PERSPECTIVE
.
