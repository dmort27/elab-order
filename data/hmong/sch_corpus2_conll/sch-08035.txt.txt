...
so
what
am
I
trying
to
get
across
?


Politic
or
not
,
I
certainly
not
taking
sides
here
,
but
from
what
I
heard
an
audio
tape
recorded
by
Laura
Xiong
,
it
gave
me
a
creep
....
I
have
a
very
cold
feeling
toward
Hmoob
18
xeem
.


I
do
agree
that
Laura
certainly
was
being
too
honest
about
those
Hmoob
who
came
to
Dej
Dawb
,
but
maybe
because
what
she
was
trying
to
do
was
helping
those
who
truely
and
desperatly
needed
help
,
NOT
those
who
were
in
search
for
a
better
life
.


The
war
end
30
years
ago
,
the
only
people
who
needed
help
are
those
still
in
the
jungle
running
for
their
lives
.


I
personally
do
n't
like
the
attitude
of
what
could
be
Hmoob
18
xeem
or
who
ever
the
man
on
that
audio
tape
.


My
question
is
so
you
want
to
be
my
leader
or
should
I
say
....
''
a
Hmoob
leader
''
this
is
all
you
got
!


threatening
against
some
one
life
?


Com
on
!
...


what
kind
of
a
politic
are
playing
here
?


who
do
you
think
you
are
?


So
if
you
kill
Laura
Xiong
would
that
make
you
a
bigger
man
or
a
better
Hmoob
leader
?


You
all
want
to
take
credit
for
saving
a
Hmoob
life
but
acting
like
bunch
stupid
low
life
scums
.


Do
your
self
a
favorite
,
who
ever
made
a
call
to
threatening
Laura
's
life
,
give
her
a
call
to
apoligy
and
perhaps
you
all
should
work
togethers
instead
of
fighting
for
your
own
stupid
ego
...
