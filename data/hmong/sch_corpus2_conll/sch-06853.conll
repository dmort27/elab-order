You
are
obviously
missing
a
lot
of
my
sarcasm
,
but
oh
well
...
I
am
honored
that
you
would
like
to
meet
me
in
person
,
and
I
suppose
that
time
will
come
sooner
or
later
.


But
as
for
the
apology
,
I
already
did
that
so
you
need
n't
expect
anymore
--
I
am
still
waiting
for
you
to
accept
the
first
apology
,
and
then
apologize
to
me
.
