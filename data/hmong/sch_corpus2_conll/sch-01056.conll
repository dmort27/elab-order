I
WOULD
RATHER
HAVE
PEOPLE
BEING
ABLE
TO
PROTEST
ON
THE
STREET
THAN
COW-TOWING
THE
PARTY
LINE
AND
GET
YOUR
MOUTH
SHUT
LIKE
SOME
REMAINING
COMMUNIST
REMNANT
REGIMES
.


SOUMALY
,
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
NOW
YOU
LIVE
IN
THE
LAND
OF
FREEDOM
,
YOU
DO
N'T
WANT
TO
SEE
ANY
PROTEST
AT
ALL
?


THAT
WOULD
BE
LIKE
FLEEING
AN
OPPRESSIVE
REGIME
ONLY
TO
EMBRACE
IT
ONCE
YOU
FIND
THE
REAL
FREEDOM
.


COME
ON
.


MAKE
UP
YOUR
MIND
NOW
OR
DO
YOU
WANT
A
DICTATORSHIP
HERE
IN
AMERICA
LIKE
DUBYA
HAD
WISHED
FOR
WHILE
HE
WAS
THE
PREZ
.
