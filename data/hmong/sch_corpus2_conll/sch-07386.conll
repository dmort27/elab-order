Military
atrocities
against
Hmong
children
are
war
crimes
Amnesty
International
is
horrified
by
recent
reports
,
including
video
evidence
and
witness
testimony
,
of
an
attack
by
Lao
soldiers
against
a
group
of
five
children
,
four
of
them
girls
,
in
the
Xaisomboune
military
zone
on
19
May
2004
.


The
children
,
aged
between
13
and
16
years
old
and
part
of
an
ethnic
Hmong
rebel
group
,
were
brutally
mutilated
--
the
girls
apparently
raped
before
being
killed
--
by
a
group
of
approximately
30-40
soldiers
.


The
victims
--
four
girls
,
Mao
Lee
,
14
;
her
sister
Chao
Lee
,
16
;
Chi
Her
,
14
;
Pang
Lor
,
14
;
and
Tou
Lor
,
Pang
Lor
's
15
year
old
brother
--
were
killed
whilst
foraging
for
food
close
to
their
camp
.


They
were
unarmed
.


The
attacks
violate
the
most
fundamental
principles
of
international
human
rights
and
humanitarian
law
.


These
rapes
and
killings
constitute
war
crimes
.


The
Lao
authorities
must
bring
to
justice
those
responsible
for
this
atrocity
and
cease
attacks
on
unarmed
civilians
.


A
witness
,
who
has
subsequently
fled
the
country
and
been
recognized
as
a
refugee
by
the
United
Nations
High
Commissioner
for
Refugees
,
reported
hearing
one
of
the
soldiers
saying
:
``
Meo
(
Hmong
)
.


Your
kael
ni
(
mouth
)
allows
you
to
speak
.


Your
hin
(
vagina
)
allows
you
to
breed
''
.


He
then
heard
moans
and
a
gunshot
.


Mao
Lee
was
shot
in
each
breast
and
the
other
bodies
were
mutilated
by
what
appears
to
be
high-powered
rifle
shots
fired
at
close
range
.


One
of
the
girls
was
disembowelled
.


Several
other
members
of
the
group
were
seriously
injured
with
gun
shot
wounds
but
managed
to
return
to
their
encampment
.


The
rebels
have
little
if
any
medicine
and
rely
on
traditional
treatments
using
plants
found
in
the
forest
.


The
Lao
authorities
must
,
as
a
matter
of
utmost
urgency
,
permit
UN
agencies
and
independent
monitors
unfettered
access
to
those
rebels
who
are
recently
reported
to
have
'surrendered
'
.


They
must
also
permit
humanitarian
agencies
to
provide
medical
and
food
assistance
to
those
injured
as
a
result
of
this
and
other
military
actions
against
the
rebels
.


Background
The
Hmong
ethnic
minority
group
in
Laos
was
allied
to
the
US
during
the
Viet
Nam
war
and
its
spill-over
fighting
in
both
Laos
and
Cambodia
.


The
Hmong
people
have
a
long
history
of
resistance
and
aspirations
of
independence
from
Lao
government
control
.


Following
the
creation
of
the
Lao
People
's
Democratic
Republic
in
1975
and
the
fall
of
the
former
regime
,
as
many
as
a
third
of
the
Hmong
ethnic
minority
are
believed
to
have
fled
the
country
.


Most
of
these
refugees
resettled
in
the
USA
,
but
a
large
number
spent
many
years
in
refugee
camps
in
Thailand
.


Sporadic
military
resistance
to
the
government
has
continued
among
some
ethnic
groups
,
predominantly
Hmong
.


There
are
also
continuing
allegations
of
serious
human
rights
abuses
against
those
Hmong
perceived
as
still
being
opposed
to
the
Lao
government
.


There
have
been
increasing
concerns
over
the
last
two
years
at
an
apparent
increase
in
Lao
government
military
activity
against
rebel
groups
,
who
along
with
armed
adult
men
also
comprise
a
large
number
of
women
,
children
,
elderly
and
sick
.


The
upsurge
in
military
activity
followed
increasing
international
concern
at
the
situation
,
which
was
triggered
by
a
number
of
journalists
visiting
rebel
groups
and
reporting
their
plight
.


Credible
sources
have
reported
the
deaths
of
scores
of
civilians
,
mainly
children
,
from
starvation
and
injuries
sustained
during
the
conflict
.


It
is
known
that
several
of
approximately
20
rebel
groups
with
their
families
are
surrounded
by
Lao
military
and
prevented
from
foraging
for
food
that
they
traditionally
rely
on
to
survive
.


Amnesty
International
has
protested
to
the
Lao
authorities
at
what
it
believes
is
the
use
of
starvation
as
a
weapon
of
war
against
civilians
.


Several
hundred
ethnic
Hmong
rebels
are
reported
to
