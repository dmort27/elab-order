i
do
believe
that
your
post
is
correct
.


many
people
ask
me
``
es
cov
hmoob
nyob
suav
teb
(
all
hmong
)
puas
coj
li
peb
coj
''
...
i
usually
say
''
nco
ntsoov
tias
peb
ib
leeg
txia
ib
yam
lawm
...
cov
hmoob
nplog
teb
tsi
coj
li
hmoob
suav
teb
nawb
...
vim
tias
cov
nyob
suav
teb
are
too
chinese
...
and
cov
nplog
teb
are
too
hmong
..
''
its
a
weird
answer
but
its
true
.


i
also
believe
that
the
word
hmong
yog
ib
qhov
term
tshiab
...
way
newer
than
``
miao
''
....
and
hmong
only
applies
to
a
certain
``
group
''
of
miao
.
