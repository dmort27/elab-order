WANTING
TO
BE
A
LAO
CITIZEN
IS
NOT
UNLAWFUL
,
BUT
BEING
A
US
CITIZEN
AND
IS
INVOLVED
IN
ACTIVITIES
AIMED
AT
DESTABILIZING
A
SOVEIGN
NATION
LIKE
LAOS
IS
.


THOSE
WHO
PARTICIPATED
IN
SUCH
ACTIVITIES
OUGHT
TO
BE
PROSECUTED
TO
THE
FULL
EXTEND
OF
THE
LAWS
.


SOMETIMES
I
WONDER
IF
THEY
WANTED
TO
FIGHT
THE
LPDR
SO
MUCH
,
WHY
THE
FUCK
ARE
THEY
HERE
IN
US
?


TO
SLAVE
THEMSELF
,
HAD
ENOUGH
MONEY
TO
BUY
A
PC
AND
THE
INTERNET
SERVICE
,
AND
MAKING
AN
EMPTY
THREAT
TO
THOSE
WHO
DISAGREED
WITH
THEM
AND
THEIR
IDEOLOGY
?


WHAT
A
FUCKING
LOSER
...
RAN
AWAY
FROM
HOME
SO
THEY
CAN
MOUTH
OFF
ELSEWHERE
....
IS
THAT
THE
HONORABLE
CONDUCT
WHICH
THEY
OFTEN
CLAIM
?


BOY
,
TALKING
ABOUT
THESE
FUCKING
IDIOTS
WO
N'T
GET
YOU
ANYWHERE
.


AMEN
AMEN
