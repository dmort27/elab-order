Why
are
you
hiding
your
words
and
close
your
mouth
?


You
have
the
opportunity
to
say
anything
you
want
.

Your
statement
below
indicated
that
I
should
be
involved
with
all
the
murders
in
Thailand
and
Laos
,
right
?


Why
not
you
just
say
straight
to
point
that
you
want
to
say
instead
of
going
around
the
skin
.


You
can
be
right
that
I
was
part
of
the
killing
but
you
know
sooner
or
later
the
international
justice
will
tell
who
responsible
for
all
the
killings
.


Do
n't
worry
,
your
words
is
more
powerful
than
who
you
are
.
