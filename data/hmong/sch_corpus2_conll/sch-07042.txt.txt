AND
I
DO
N'T
HAVE

TO
IMPROVE

TOO

WHEN
I
WAS
IN

THERE
WAS
A
,
MY
,
HMONG
TEACHER
HE
TOUGHT

,
HE
CAME
UP
WITH
A
WAY
THAT
IT
IS
VERY
EASY
TO
READ
AND
CAN
READ
FASTER
THAN
THOSE
WE
USE
NOWADAY
.


HE
ACTUALLY
WROTE
A
STORY
AND
USING
HIS
NEW
METHODOLOGY
(
NEW
MODIFICATION
)
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHERE
OR
WHAT
COUNTRY
HE
LEFT
FOR

I
SIMPLY
DO
N'T
RECALL
HIS
NAME
.


HE
COULD
WRITE
A
PAGE
IN
FRENCH
TELL
A
STORY
ABOUT
HOW
THE
PATHET
LAO
TAKE
OVER
LAOS
AND
TRANSLATE
IT
INTO
HIS
NEW
HMONG
VERSION
(
HIS
MODIFICATION
)
.


WE
COULD
READ
IT
FAST
AND
EASY
.


BUT
I
AM
ALL
FORGOT
NOW
.


I
THINK
NOW
HE
IS
IN
BETWEEN
48
TO
60
.


AND
I
MISS
HIM
.

A
thirsty
Crow
found
a
Pitcher
with
some
water
in
it
,
but
so
little
was
there
,
that
try
as
he
might
,
he
could
not
reach
it
with
his
beak
,
and
it
seemed
as
he
would
die
of
thirst
.


At
last
he
hit
upon
a
clever
plan
.


He
started
dropping
pebbles
into
the
Pitcher
of
water
,
and
with
each
pebble
the
water
level
rose
a
little
higher
until
at
last
it
reached
the
brim
,
and
the
knowing
bird
was
able
to
to
quench
his
thirst
.
