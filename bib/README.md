## Interface between phonology, morphology, and syntax

### Shih and Zuraw (2017)

General predictors

* Adjective-noun default order
* Preference of -ng over na linker between adjective/noun

Phonological predictors

* Weight -- longer words, stronger preference for default order
* Phonotactics: nasal OCP -- avoidance of sequence of nasal consonants (MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR)
* Contextual markedness: \*NCË³
* Phonological and morphological alignment -- preference for syllable and morpheme boundaries to align
* Syllable-structure optimization -- avoidance of hiatus

Non-phonological predictors

* Quantifier adjectives -- occur first more often
* Adjective prototypicality -- adjectives with ma- prefix occur first more often
* Frequency -- more frequent nouns occur first more often

## Artificial language learning

### Moreton and Pater (2012)

#### Part I

Number of Relevant Features

* Participants trained to divide stimuli into "legal" and "illegal" categories
* Phonological pattern that depends on a single feature easier than one that requires more features

Relations between Features

* Patterns relating two instances of same feature produce larger familiarity effects than those relating instances of different features
* Shorter-range dependencies not easier to learn than longer-range ones

#### Part II

* No evidence that harmony is easier to learn than disharmony
* Mixed results for consonant-vowel interaction rules (e.g., palatalization) and prosodic rules (e.g., stress on heavier syllables)
* Results fail to match typology

Structurally-Biased Phonology
* Formal structure over phonetic substance
* Phonological patterns predicted to become less phonetically-motivated over time
